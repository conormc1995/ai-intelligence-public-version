Teaching English as a second language in a foreign country can be daunting, even for experienced instructors. Regardless of the subject being taught, teaching comes with all kinds of challenges – children with different learning styles, and knowledge and you must adapt to the differences while ensuring each learner benefits from the lesson and doesn’t fall behind. For ESL (English Second Language) teachers, imparting this knowledge can be rewarding to both teacher and student. ESL teachers English Second Language teachers are also known as TESOL, EFL, and Literacy teachers. ESL teachers can work in their own countries or choose to teach abroad. They also have the option and flexibility to teach remotely or in front of the classroom. ESL teachers can teach children and adults, in private lessons or small groups to help them improve their reading, writing, and speaking skills. These individuals have roles that go above and beyond just teaching. They are educators, mentors, and supporters, and sometimes serve as friends in the lives of their students. They help their students gain confidence in learning and speaking a new language and help prepare their students for their transition to living in an English-speaking country. ESL requirements and tasks To become an ESL teacher, many countries require an undergraduate degree, fluency in English, a valid TEFL certificate, and some in-class ESL training. For teachers who choose to work online, computer literacy and strong written and verbal communication skills are important. Cultural awareness, problem-solving, and classroom management are also handy skills to have for all ESL teachers. ESL instructors are responsible for preparing lesson plans and customising their plans to accommodate the different learning styles as well as preparing students’ progress reports.

These are some creative pleasures we all enjoy – the plot, actors, sound and music effects, and how the story moves seamlessly from one scene to the next. This sequence is the work of a video editor. To learn more about this behind-the-scenes storyteller, we went into the Video Editing Industry Corner and spoke to Bradley Pather. Read on to learn more about the field and how you can make your big break. Introduction and background Tell us a bit about your experience. I’ve been in the video production industry for around 15 years. During that time I’ve been fortunate enough to work for companies that cater to different industries, spanning from Wildlife, to Corporate to Entertainment and even Weddings and lifestyles. What made you decide to pursue a career as a video editor? Cinema and film were something I’ve always loved while growing up. This led me to think of myself as a bit of a movie buff (totally self-proclaimed) so naturally, when it came time to pick something to study after high school, I chose to do my degree in Television and Film. What type of video editing do you specialise in? At the moment I’m specialising in digital content creation for websites and social. What courses did you take to become a video editor? I’ve completed a television and film course at DUT and specialised in video editing. Over and above that, a lot of things were self-taught cause the industry is forever changing. What is your favourite part about video editing? The creative ways we get to construct and interpret stories. What is your least favourite part of video editing? Having to make the hard choices of what makes the edit and what doesn’t, sometimes having to leave some beautiful shots and moments on the cutting room floor. Video editing What is video editing? Video editing is the manipulation and arrangement of video shots to tell a story or present information. What do you think are the most important skills for a video editor? Attention to detail, a creative flare and a strong ability to problem solve. What do you think is the most difficult part of being a video editor? For me personally, it would be dealing with revisions and feedback. Video editing is a collaborative process and editors often need to make changes based on feedback from clients or other stakeholders. It can be challenging to incorporate these revisions while still maintaining the overall vision and quality of the project. How do you approach a video editing project? I have a systematic way of approaching my edits. Understanding the project requirements. Organising footage and any assets needed. Create a rough cut. Do refinements. Final touches. The feedback and revisions. What do you think is the most important part of the video editing process? I would say it’s storytelling. Video editing is not just about putting together different shots or scenes; it’s about telling a story, conveying a message, or evoking emotions through visuals and audio. While technical skills are crucial in video editing, storytelling is what separates an excellent video editor from an average one. What do you think are the biggest challenges facing video editors during the editing process? I think every video editor is different and unique so the challenges vary accordingly, to the individual’s strengths and weaknesses. I’ve worked with editors that struggle to maintain consistency across their edits, and I’ve also seen editors struggle with managing time effectively. It does vary. Technical questions How important is it to stay updated about new trends and tools? Staying updated is crucial for video editors who want to remain competitive and deliver high-quality work to their clients. It’s overall going to keep you relevant in the game. What makes a perfect visual story? There are a few things that would make a good visual story (I’m not sure if there is such a thing as a ‘perfect visual story’). I’d say it’s a combination of visual appeal, emotional engagement, clear messaging and narrative structure as also the pacing of the piece as well as the attention to detail. What do you think are the most important features of good video editors? Some of the most important features would be things like creativity, adaptability, solid technical ability, great communication skills overall and definitely being able to collaborate. What are the best video editing software apps and tools you need as a video editor? The industry standard would be Premiere Pro (Definitely worth knowing other Creative Suit apps, such as After Effects, Photoshop etc.) Final Cut, Avid Media Composer, DaVinci Resolve. A day in the life of a video editor: What specific duties have you performed as a video editor? Over my time in post-productions, I’ve gotten to perform all of them. Reviewing raw footage and selecting the best takes to use. Trimming footage and arranging it to tell a compelling story. Insert elements that would enhance the final product. Audio levels and colour grading. Incorporating client feedback and making changes to the final. What is the one skill that is very important to inculcate as a video editor? I think one of the skills that undoubtedly needs to be instilled in a video editor is problem-solving. Very often we can get bogged down by a shot that wasn’t captured correctly, a piece of audio that is corrupted/missing, or maybe that shadow being cast on the subject is too noticeable. In cases like these, we have to be able to problem-solve and move on with the edit as best we can. Problem-solving and making a strong cup of coffee. Describe your daily routine as a video editor. For most people in production, the day always starts with coffee. The more intense the edit the stronger the caffeine. I then normally would take a few mins to check and reply to emails, and watch a YT video or two (You can often find inspiration from something random you might see on YT or Social media). And then continue or get started with my edits. During my edit process, I tend to take small breaks in between, as I find fresh eyes can often spot issues you may not have seen earlier. What kind of strategies and mindset are required for this role? Different people will gravitate to strategies and mindsets that will work for them. For me, I try to be very planned out in my approach. I often have a list that I create at the start of the day and will try to finish tasks in my edit before I take a break. Then when I’m back from my break, I’ll watch my edit (or the previously worked-on section) and, if I’m happy, move on to my next item on the list. I find that this approach allows me to check myself and my work as I move along without letting things slip through the cracks and also guides me with time management. What is the biggest challenge that you foresee in this job? As of late many people see A. I as replacing creatives in the industry is a huge challenge. While A. I has been really impressive and I sometimes make use of it myself. Having a real-life video editor who can deal with a client either face to face, over a phone call or by email is something that can’t be replaced. Human interaction in production is what makes the end result magical. Getting started as a video editor: How long does it take to become a video editor? The time it takes to become a video editor can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of editing work you want to pursue, your existing skills, and the amount of time and effort you’re willing to dedicate to learning and practising video editing. What is the golden rule of editing? One of the rules I was taught over the years would be ‘Show, don’t tell’ I’m not sure if this could be regarded as the ‘Golden Rule’ but definitely an important rule. The basis of the rule is that instead of simply telling the audience what is happening or how a character is feeling, the editor should use visual and auditory cues to convey the same information. How do I start editing videos with no experience? The best way I found is just to get stuck in. We thankfully live in an age where there are a ton of helpful tutorials online, and places like Alison that can assist with learning tricks and techniques. Experiment, play around and practice. Final thoughts The most remarkable moment in your career so far? Definitely, moments that stand out for me would be getting to travel to the Philippines and Samoa, where I worked on two seasons of Survivor. What are the possible career paths for someone who has completed (or is about to complete) their video editing qualification? Ultimately the path will depend on your interest, skills and goals. You could gravitate more towards broadcast and TV, alternatively, maybe you see yourself in advertising or digital and social media marketing companies. Other options could be corporate or education-based editing, post-production houses or independent filmmaking. What tips do you have for someone just starting out in video editing? As cliché as this is going to sound, I think just being ‘patient and persistent’. Skill and understanding will develop over time. Also never stop learning, keep adding to your bag of tricks and you’ll eventually become an editing wizard.

What’s long and green and only shows up once a year? Why it’s the St. Patrick’s Day parade of course. In Ireland and many places in the world, you may encounter a lot of green, fireworks, folklores and tales, Irish limericks, beer drinking, shamrocks, leprechauns, and a host of other displays to mark the occasion. What is St Patrick’s Day? St Patrick’s Day is celebrated annually on the 17th of March. This now-global celebration of the Irish patron saint is to honour him for bringing the Christian faith to Ireland. It’s celebrated on March 17th because it marks the day that the patron saint died in 461 A. D. However, it has become more than a religious celebration of Saint Patrick. Today, it is a green-themed international festival of all things Irish. Besides the sea of green that we see on St. Patrick’s Day, how much do you know about St Patrick’s Day? Fun facts about Ireland and St Patrick’s Day St Patrick’s name was Maewyn Succat. It is believed he was born in Britain, not Ireland, at the end of the 4th century. It is said that St Patrick was kidnapped at age 16 and sold into slavery on Northern Island. He worked for six years before escaping to Britain and eventually returning to Ireland as a Christian missionary. Ireland is the second-largest island in Europe. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe book series based on mythical Narnia were written by Irish-born author C. S. Lewis. Although green is popularly the colour of St Paddy’s Day, the patron saint was initially associated with blue. Green is considered an unlucky colour in Ireland, but this changed in the 19th century because of Ireland’s lush green landscape (Emerald Isle) and its link to Irish mythology and flag. Chicago, in the US, has a large Irish population and in celebrating St Patrick’s Day, uses 40 pounds of eco-friendly food dye to colour their Chicago River green. This unique way of celebrating started in 1962 and stays green for several hours. The Irish traditionally wear shamrocks (Ireland’s emblem/national flower) on their lapels. The three-leaved plant holds significant meaning to Christians and symbolises St Patrick’s Day and Ireland. The leaves represent faith, hope, love and the Holy Trinity. If you find a rare four-leaf clover, it is believed it will bring you “luck”. Ireland’s famous Curracloe Beach was the background for two Academy-award-winning films, Saving Private Ryan, and Brooklyn. Get in on the festivities You can join in on the St Paddy’s celebrations even if you’re not in Ireland. Here are some fun ways you can get in on the festivities. Attend a St Patrick’s Day parade Learn about Irish history Grab a Guinness or an Irish whiskey Host a green-themed party/wear green Enrol in a few traditional Irish music courses like the guitar, the traditional Irish Sean-nós Singing course, the fiddle, or the bodhrán. Cook up a traditional Irish meal of ham and cabbage. The famous corned beef and cabbage meal was a cheaper alternative for impoverished immigrants in the USA. Tell a funny joke (or two). Question: What do you call an Irish spider? Answer: Paddy long legs. Question: When does a leprechaun cross the street? Answer: When it turns green. Question: How can you tell if an Irishman is having a good time? Answer: He’s Dublin over with laughter. There you have it. Now you are armed and informed, with a few jokes in the bag, to wow your friends and guests wherever you celebrate St Patrick’s Day.

Parenting is without a doubt, a beautiful yet at times challenging role without a manual, that many people take on. The reward: priceless. One of our graduates, a proud mother of three, Andrea Morris, decided to learn about disabilities and empower herself and her family. We spoke to her to find out how her Diploma in Special Needs has helped her raise her sons and the impact it’s had on her family. Tell us a bit about yourself. I am 45 years old. I am a wife, my husband recently retired from the military, I am a mother of six sons and my three young sons are special needs. I am a full-time student who’s earning a bachelor’s degree in business administration. I wear many hats within my family. I am the head production manager for a local uprising filming company.

When my sons were diagnosed with autism and other health conditions, I had some knowledge of their condition because I had a career in early childhood education. The challenge I faced was now I’m going through this on a personal level. What did you find most interesting or surprising in the course? Discovering that there are various ways to assist students with learning disabilities and the Rigidity of Thought and Repetitive Patterns of Behavior in children with Autism.

Every day, we hear and in extreme situations, experience the impact of environmental damage and climate change. To learn more about these realities, we’re shining the Alison Publisher Spotlight on Richard Boothman, associate lecturer and founder of Ideostone Limited, to tell us more. Introduction and Background Please share with our learners a bit about your background. I grew up on a small farm in northern England and went to college to study one of the first environmental courses available in the UK. This is how my interest in environmental issues began. In the late 1990s, I began a degree with The Open University, and I graduated in 2003. Prior to graduating, I worked as an Associate Lecturer at The Open University. I have been doing this part-time now for about 20 years and until recently I have been tutoring on four different environmental modules at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. When Brexit happened, I began to write my own environmental courses and when the world changed due to Covid, we moved all our courses online. Where did your interest in environmental issues stem from? Growing up on a farm in the 1960s, it was clear even then that we were getting many things wrong. I have maintained an interest in the environmental sector since then. The opportunity to learn more about the underlying theories and concepts and then to help students to grasp these same concepts and theories has led me to this relatively late, but very welcome change in my career. Ideostone Limited What is the idea behind Ideostone Limited? Our aim is to encourage as many people as possible to become informed about the environment and environmental issues. Ideostone Limited is the vehicle that enables us to develop and sell online learning courses. What is your vision for Ideostone and how is Alison helping you achieve your goal? I want to help a much wider group of people to become aware of the whole range of environmental issues that we currently face. In a very small way, we want Ideostone to help with this transition by informing more people about the issues. Alison is helping us to achieve our goal because it enables us to generate a small income from our courses while providing learners with valuable free resources. More than 2000 people have enrolled in our first Alison course – Introduction to Environmental Literacy – and in the few days since our new course launched, more than 100 learners have already enrolled. Please share with our readers about your course. Our new course is “Introduction to Climate Breakdown”. The climate crisis is the most significant of several linked environmental and social crises we face. We try to present this information in an easily accessible form that will enable a wide range of people to engage with the material. We hope that all those people who study our courses will have a much better understanding of the issues and feel empowered to do something about it. Who should be enrolling in your course? When we first began developing the course, it was aimed at the parents and grandparents of children who were learning about climate breakdown at school and who might have their own questions. It should, therefore, act as a valuable primer for anyone who might be interested in studying the topic in more depth. Or someone who is interested in a career in the environmental sector and wants to know more about the issues. An awareness of climate breakdown is important for most employees. Many companies and other organisations recognise the need to reduce their impact on the environment and need employees who understand the issues and where to begin to take action. Our course should provide these people with a basic grounding in the topic. Why should we be interested in learning about and understanding environmental issues? We all need to be interested in environmental issues because they are affecting us all, now. And if we do not do something about them, the impacts will become more and more severe to the extent that the planet may no longer support human life. We have an increasingly narrow window of opportunity to act decisively and the more people who understand this and are willing to take action, the more chance we have of making a difference. How can people get involved and make a difference? Many communities across the world are now recognising that we need to take action to deal with climate breakdown. Find your local activist group and join them. If you are time-poor, support them with donations or support in kind. Once you have some knowledge about climate breakdown and other environmental crises, talk about them. Engage your family and friends and encourage them to learn and act too. Follow and support environmental organisations who are working in this space (an internet search will reveal many). Write to your government representative(s) to make sure they are aware of your support for environmental change. If they are not receptive, vote for someone else at the next election. Support companies who are acting. Few are taking meaningful action even now but find the best. If you really need that new tee shirt or piece of furniture, find out the best-performing companies in that sector and buy from them. Social media has become a bit toxic recently, but it can still have an impact on companies who want to sell things to you. Publishing on Alison What made you decide to create courses on Alison? Alison approached us at a time when we were looking for an additional platform for our courses. The courses being free to students made it available to a different, and potentially larger, audience and we decided to try it. You’ve been a self-publisher with Alison for several years. What do you enjoy most about publishing on this platform? The support we have received from the team at Alison encourages us to carry on despite the challenges we face. What lessons or takeaways have you learned as a self-publisher on Alison? Allow plenty of time to upload your material onto the platform. Don’t expect to make money quickly. It takes time to build up a significant number of students. How has being a self-publisher on Alison changed or impacted your life? It is good to know that environmental knowledge and awareness are being accessed by many learners, from all around the world. What do people enjoy most about your course? The animated video sections receive good comments – they are a way to inject some humour and provide memorable images to reinforce learning. Learning environmental management and other issues What skills and qualities would help an individual succeed in this environmental studies and management? Curiosity, a willingness to ask questions mind and a real desire to engage with the material. Do not accept the status quo. Challenge everything. What are the biggest challenges learners face going into the environmental space? If you want a career in the sector, there are plenty of opportunities but, as with all opportunities, you need to be able to stand out from your competitors. Studying the topic on Alison, making changes in your own lifestyle, and, perhaps, engaging with local action groups, are good ways to stand out. Organisations fighting climate change Who are some key individuals and/or organisations that people can follow to learn more about or contribute to? There are so many clever, interesting, and insightful individuals and organisations working in the sector that it is difficult to single them out. Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and WWF are active in this space. If you are up for being more radical, then Extinction Rebellion is worth considering. Fridays for Future and the School Strike for Climate have both arisen from the protests started by Greta Thunberg. If you are interested in science, Michael Mann, Katherine Heyhoe, and Johan Rockstrom are interesting people. You should also look at organisations like NASA, the NOAA, and The Hadley Centre. Last Thoughts What words of advice would you give someone who would like to become a publisher on Alison? Structure your course in line with the requirements of the publishing platform. Keep in touch with your contact person – they are great at responding to any queries. What has been your most important lesson or discovery when it comes to online education programmes? Don’t expect a good income – at least not straight away. What else can Alison and its learners look forward to from you in the coming year to two? We do not currently have any plans for another Alison course. We will monitor the latest one for student uptake and revenue before deciding. We’re looking at some (live?) and interactive events later in the year and will be providing information on these via LinkedIn and our own website. Any last words, advice, or wisdom you’d like to share with our learners? Do something!!! We don’t need to be hard-core activists or environmentalists to effect change and speak up about environmental issues. We are all responsible for playing our part in preserving the earth for those who are coming after us. I cannot do everything, but I can do something. And because I cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do the something that I can do.” ― Edward Everett Hale","length":9385,"tokens":1819,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Alison Publisher Spotlight: Richard Boothman","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-publisher-spotlight-richard-boothman","essay_date":"Mar 13, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"It’s difficult to ignore the stories of floods, earthquakes, cyclones, tropical storms, severe heat, and changing weather conditions that flood the news headlines weekly.

More than 2000 people have enrolled in our first Alison course – Introduction to Environmental Literacy – and in the few days since our new course launched, more than 100 learners have already enrolled. Please share with our readers about your course. Our new course is “Introduction to Climate Breakdown” The climate crisis is the most significant of several linked environmental and social crises we face. We try to present this information in an easily accessible form that will enable a wide range of people to engage with the material.","content_length":1023,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Publisher Spotlight: Richard Boothman","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-publisher-spotlight-richard-boothman","essay_date":"Mar 13, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"We hope that all those people who study our courses will have a much better understanding of the issues and feel empowered to do something about it. Who should be enrolling in your course? When we first began developing the course, it was aimed at the parents and grandparents of children who were learning about climate breakdown at school and who might have their own questions. It should, therefore, act as a valuable primer for anyone who might be interested in studying the topic in more depth. Or someone who is interested in a career in the environmental sector and wants to know more about the issues. An awareness of climate breakdown is important for most employees. Many companies and other organisations recognise the need to reduce their impact on the environment and need employees who understand the issues and where to begin to take action. Our course should provide these people with a basic grounding in the topic.","content_length":932,"content_tokens":171,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Publisher Spotlight: Richard Boothman","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-publisher-spotlight-richard-boothman","essay_date":"Mar 13, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"Why should we be interested in learning about and understanding environmental issues? We all need to be interested in environmental issues because they are affecting us all, now. And if we do not do something about them, the impacts will become more and more severe to the extent that the planet may no longer support human life. We have an increasingly narrow window of opportunity to act decisively and the more people who understand this and are willing to take action, the more chance we have of making a difference. How can people get involved and make a difference? Many communities across the world are now recognising that we need to take action to deal with climate breakdown. Find your local activist group and join them. If you are time-poor, support them with donations or support in kind. Once you have some knowledge about climate breakdown and other environmental crises, talk about them. Engage your family and friends and encourage them to learn and act too.","content_length":975,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Publisher Spotlight: Richard Boothman","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-publisher-spotlight-richard-boothman","essay_date":"Mar 13, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"Follow and support environmental organisations who are working in this space (an internet search will reveal many) Write to your government representative(s) to make sure they are aware of your support for environmental change.

They are leaders. Be it in the home, communities, the sports arena, arts, and culture, or even leading Fortune 500 companies, there is no limit to what women can accomplish. For years and throughout history, women have been blazing trails and making incredible and life-changing contributions to their worlds. The impact of these reverberates across the world to this day. Many have come and gone, paving the way for today’s generation of women to carry the torch in their own fields. On International Women’s Day, we celebrate and recognise the amazing contributions of some of these women. International Women’s Day Every year on March 8th, we celebrate International Women’s Day (IWD). This day is set aside annually to celebrate the social, cultural, economic, and political achievements of women across the globe. It’s also a significant day to highlight the advocacy for women’s rights globally. It is through the collective efforts and actions of everyone globally that International Women’s Day can be impactful. This year, the focus is on #EmbracingEquity. Equity means treating every person fairly and according to their respective needs. Where the needs may be different, the rights, benefits, and opportunities available should be equal. Celebrating (some) inspirational women ‘Each time a woman stands up for herself, without knowing it possibly, without claiming it, she stands up for all women.’ – Maya Angelou We thought we should share some of the courageous acts by women throughout history. From the famed history-makers to lesser-known names, here are some wonder women who have done incredible things. Be inspired: Marie Curie (1867-1934) Marie Curie, a French and Polish chemist, and physicist is a two-time Noble laureate. The only woman to achieve this incredible feat. She moved to Paris, France to continue her education and pioneered work in radioactivity and cancer treatment protocols. She discovered radium and polonium, and through this discovery and developing radiology and other treatments was able to save countless lives of cancer patients. Marie is also lauded as being the creator of portable x-ray machines and which were used to save the lives of many soldiers on the front lines of World War I. Bessie Coleman (1892 – 1926) Bessie, a black woman in the US, was prevented from acquiring her pilot’s license because she was black and a woman. This did not stop her dreams. Bessie moved to France and soon became the first African American woman of Native-American roots, to earn her aviation license. Maria Montessori (1870 – 1952) Maria Montessori is the creator of the Montessori style of education. Here, she spearheaded the thought that children deserve not only the best education but a choice in their learning. Her education system, which has been adopted in many countries, focuses on the science of child development and sets this classroom apart from traditional teaching methods. Coretta Scott-King (1927 -2006) Coretta Scott-King is the wife of the late American civil rights movement leader, Martin Luther King Jr. She held her own as a leader in the 50s and 60s as an author and fought for the rights and dignity of all victims who were discriminated against. Katharine Graham (1917-2001) Katharine Graham, Pulitzer Prize winner for her autobiography, Personal History in 1998, sat as the editor and chairman of the Washington Post for 20 years (1963-1991). Under her leadership, the Post broke the infamous Pentagon Papers and the Watergate scandal, making it one of the most highly regarded publications in the world. She is also the first-ever female CEO of a Fortune 500 company. She broke the glass ceiling and let all women know that they can reach the pinnacle of their dream. Her life was inspirational and her story, played by Academy award-winner Meryl Streep, can be seen in the hit movie The Post. Wangari Mathaai (1940 – 2011) Wangari Mathaai is a Kenyan-born social, environmental and political activist. Wangari was the first woman in Central and East Africa to obtain a PhD and in 1977, she founded the Green Belt Movement. This NGO encouraged women to be part of the fight against deforestation and environmental degradation. Since its inception, the Green Belt Movement has planted over 50 million trees. Wangari shone the African flag high as the first African woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her contribution to sustainable development, democracy, and peace. Ruth Bader Ginsburg (1933-2020) Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the co-founder of the Women’s Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. She was also appointed as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. From her time on the bench, she advocated for women’s rights and supported various LGBT initiatives and movements against racial equality. Malala Yousafzai (1997 – ) Malala Yousafzai was just 15 years old when she was shot in the head by terrorists while on her way to school. As a young activist, she was vocal about the prohibition of the education of girls imposed by the Pakistani Taliban group. She survived the assassination attempt and two years later, at age 17, she was jointly awarded the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize for her sacrificial and continued efforts to fight for education and children’s rights. This award made her the youngest recipient of the award. Kalpana Chalwa (1962-2003) Kalpana soared into the headlines in 1997 as the first Indian woman to be named a mission specialist by NASA and orbit into space on the Space Shuttle Columbia. This journey orbited the earth over 250 times over a two-week time span. Her second trip to space in 2003 completed over 80 experiments over 16 days. Unfortunately, she and her entire crew of astronauts did not make it back to earth when their spaceship disintegrated when it attempted to reenter earth’s atmosphere. Katherine Johnson (1918-2020) Katherine Johnson is now globally recognised as the brains behind the calculations that propelled John Glenn (astronaut) into orbit in 1962. She also went on to do the computations that sent Apollo 11 to the moon. Her story was made into the 2015 box-office hit, Hidden Figures, and she went on to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom from former US president Barack Obama. After her death in 2021 at the age of 101, the Northrop Grumman group named a spaceship after her. These women, across different generations and in different streams, did what the world told them they couldn’t. They defied the odds, overcame unique challenges, and cemented their place in history for women to follow. They and hundreds of other women whose names we don’t know are reminders of what is possible and to be celebrated for years to come. How you can celebrate IWD Women should be celebrated every day but for this marked occasion, you can get involved in several ways. Attend a virtual IWD talk/event. Donate and/or help raise funds for a charity. Go out for drinks or lunch with the women in your world and celebrate each other. Share an inspiring post on social media and hashtag #IWD2023 and #EmbraceEquity, in line with this year’s global campaign theme. Have hard but important conversations about the need for equal and enough opportunities. Show up for yourself and other women – we rise by lifting others. Buy an inspiring woman’s autobiography and read their story. These activities are a great way to shine a light on IWD, but they are short-term. What the IWD movement needs are long-term initiatives that will keep the spotlight on the value of uplifting from every background and having worthwhile discussions that will lead to changed mindsets. Because, as G. D. Anderson rightly puts it, “Women are already strong. It’s about changing the way the world perceives that strength”. Here’s to strong women. May we know them. May we be them. May we raise them. To everyone, everywhere, International Women’s Day belongs to you.","length":7938,"tokens":1686,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"International Women’s Day","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/international-womens-day","essay_date":"Mar 8, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"Women make the world go round.

There’s the unspeakable joy in watching your heart beat outside your chest as your children grow and develop their unique personalities. On the other hand, there’s also the pressure to create a happy and happy home. If you’re working outside the home, there’s the added pressure of work, looking after your aging parent, and a host of tasks and responsibilities on your to-do list. You’re always putting the needs of others before your own. But this can be detrimental to your mental health and overall well-being. Here are a few things you can do to prioritise your mental health as a parent. Understanding mental health According to the World Health Organization, mental health is “a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community”. Mental health is a basic human right and it underpins an individual’s well-being, and ability to make decisions and build strong and healthy relationships. Each person experiences mental health differently and in varying degrees with different outcomes. Moms, dads, and carers shoulder a lot of responsibility. A lack of support or inability to manage the stresses of being a parent can make an individual experience mental health issues and a lower sense of well-being. Factors affecting parental mental health There is not one cause attributed to causing mental health issues. Each person responds to situations and circumstances differently but there are some overarching issues that affect parental mental health. These and many other factors contribute to poor mental health in parents. The residual effects of the covid-19 lockdown Ill health of family members (aging parents, siblings, children) Work pressure Financial instability or loss of income Being unable to work Relational challenges Putting others first at the expense of their own needs and well-being Impact on parents’ mental health Parenting requires a lot of time and sacrifice. It comes with its fair of challenges that have an impact not on their mental well-being, but that of their children and families. In certain cases, parents who struggle with their mental health can experience difficulties in looking after the physical and emotional well-being of their child/ren. In extreme cases, this can be a prolonged period. Juggling balls An interesting concept about how to balance work and family life. We are all juggling balls in the air. Some of these balls are plastic (and will bounce back when dropped). Other balls are made of glass (and will break if dropped). What you need to do is decide which of the balls you’re juggling are plastic and which are made of glass. If you drop a plastic ball (cleaning the house), it’s okay. You can tackle the pile of dishes in the sink tomorrow. If you drop self-care (making time for your mental health), the consequences can be detrimental. Decide what’s most important and take care of that first. Tips to improve your mental health An often not spoken fact about mental health is the importance of putting a spotlight on it – talking about it and your personal challenges. And seeking help. Here are a few other helpful steps you can take to improve your mental health. Talk As a parent, we want to be strong for our children. We tend to hide negative emotions and put on a perfect exterior. We do this with the hope that we’re protecting our child/ren, but instead, it often ends up with children not being about to communicate freely when they experience negative emotions or sentiments. What you should do instead is be honest and open about your feelings so that you can explain to your children it’s normal to have such emotions and why they may be feeling low. Added to that, you should also talk to your partner, friends, family member, or therapist. Talk therapy releases bottled emotions, provides you with a safe space to share your feelings, and gives you tools to help you work through your emotions. Create a support network A lot of times, we as parents live under the impression that we can do it alone. We are superheroes who want to do it all. The truth is, no man is an island, and we were not designed to do this life thing alone. We need support. It’s important to have a strong and reliable support network that you can call on. These are the people who can give you the practical and emotional support you need when the load gets too heavy, and you feel overwhelmed. Get physical Getting physical doesn’t mean you should spend hours in the gym. This can be as simple as making time every day to take a 30-minute walk outside (take the kids along if you can). Go outside. Take in nature. Breathe in the fresh air. And for that set time, you are away from the noise of things that need to get done and you can clear your head. Other activities to consider are swimming, jogging, taking a yoga or pilates class, or even dancing. Whatever you choose to do, get your body moving and your happy hormones running through your bloodstream. Pursue your passions As parents, we often feel guilty about making time to do things that make us happy. When we have children, we put our dreams and passions to the side and focus all our attention on the kids and family. No matter how old you get, or how busy life is, we must be intentional about pursuing our passions and doing things that make us feel alive and bring us joy. Pursuing your passions, albeit not always to the same degree as before you had children, is an outlet. These help you not lose sight of yourself and your dreams (these may have just changed). Spending time on your passion will not only make you feel good about yourself, but it will be an example to your children that self-care is an important part of parenthood, and of course. Finally, the joy this brings you will improve your mental health. Final thoughts This list is by no means exhaustive. It’s important to remember as a parent that no two homes are alike. We are all different. With different needs, challenges, skills, commitments, and family structures. What works for one person’s family won’t necessarily work for yours. Therefore, it’s important to look at your setup and make changes that will suit you and your family. It’s also important to remember that no matter what it looks like on the outside, no family is perfect. Get organised. Learn a new skill or take up a new hobby. Learn to say “no”. (It’s a full sentence). If you’re feeling overwhelmed, measure your mental health and well-being today on our free mental health check-up assessment to live a happier, healthier, and more productive life tomorrow! As it’s often said, “you can’t pour from an empty cup”. It’s just as important for you as a parent to invest in your mental health.","length":6852,"tokens":1457,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Mental Health for Parents","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/mental-health-for-parents","essay_date":"Mar 6, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"Being a parent is both a pleasure and if we’re honest, exhausting at times.

If you’re working outside the home, there’s the added pressure of work, looking after your aging parent, and a host of tasks and responsibilities on your to-do list. You’re always putting the needs of others before your own. But this can be detrimental to your mental health and overall well-being. Here are a few things you can do to prioritise your mental health as a parent.","content_length":669,"content_tokens":153,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Mental Health for Parents","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/mental-health-for-parents","essay_date":"Mar 6, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"Understanding mental health According to the World Health Organization, mental health is “a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community” Mental health is a basic human right and it underpins an individual’s well-being, and ability to make decisions and build strong and healthy relationships. Each person experiences mental health differently and in varying degrees with different outcomes. Moms, dads, and carers shoulder a lot of responsibility. A lack of support or inability to manage the stresses of being a parent can make an individual experience mental health issues and a lower sense of well-being. Factors affecting parental mental health There is not one cause attributed to causing mental health issues. Each person responds to situations and circumstances differently but there are some overarching issues that affect parental mental health. These and many other factors contribute to poor mental health in parents.","content_length":1051,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Mental Health for Parents","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/mental-health-for-parents","essay_date":"Mar 6, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"The residual effects of the covid-19 lockdown Ill health of family members (aging parents, siblings, children) Work pressure Financial instability or loss of income Being unable to work Relational challenges Putting others first at the expense of their own needs and well-being Impact on parents’ mental health Parenting requires a lot of time and sacrifice. It comes with its fair of challenges that have an impact not on their mental well-being, but that of their children and families. In certain cases, parents who struggle with their mental health can experience difficulties in looking after the physical and emotional well-being of their child/ren. In extreme cases, this can be a prolonged period. Juggling balls An interesting concept about how to balance work and family life. We are all juggling balls in the air.

Tips to improve your mental health An often not spoken fact about mental health is the importance of putting a spotlight on it – talking about it and your personal challenges. And seeking help. Here are a few other helpful steps you can take to improve your mental health. Talk As a parent, we want to be strong for our children. We tend to hide negative emotions and put on a perfect exterior.","content_length":771,"content_tokens":169,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Mental Health for Parents","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/mental-health-for-parents","essay_date":"Mar 6, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"We do this with the hope that we’re protecting our child/ren, but instead, it often ends up with children not being about to communicate freely when they experience negative emotions or sentiments. What you should do instead is be honest and open about your feelings so that you can explain to your children it’s normal to have such emotions and why they may be feeling low. Added to that, you should also talk to your partner, friends, family member, or therapist. Talk therapy releases bottled emotions, provides you with a safe space to share your feelings, and gives you tools to help you work through your emotions. Create a support network A lot of times, we as parents live under the impression that we can do it alone. We are superheroes who want to do it all. The truth is, no man is an island, and we were not designed to do this life thing alone. We need support.","content_length":874,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Mental Health for Parents","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/mental-health-for-parents","essay_date":"Mar 6, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"It’s important to have a strong and reliable support network that you can call on. These are the people who can give you the practical and emotional support you need when the load gets too heavy, and you feel overwhelmed. Get physical Getting physical doesn’t mean you should spend hours in the gym. This can be as simple as making time every day to take a 30-minute walk outside (take the kids along if you can) Go outside. Take in nature. Breathe in the fresh air. And for that set time, you are away from the noise of things that need to get done and you can clear your head. Other activities to consider are swimming, jogging, taking a yoga or pilates class, or even dancing. Whatever you choose to do, get your body moving and your happy hormones running through your bloodstream.

No matter how old you get, or how busy life is, we must be intentional about pursuing our passions and doing things that make us feel alive and bring us joy. Pursuing your passions, albeit not always to the same degree as before you had children, is an outlet. These help you not lose sight of yourself and your dreams (these may have just changed) Spending time on your passion will not only make you feel good about yourself, but it will be an example to your children that self-care is an important part of parenthood, and of course. Finally, the joy this brings you will improve your mental health. Final thoughts This list is by no means exhaustive. It’s important to remember as a parent that no two homes are alike.

Then we could work for a big multinational in bustling cities or better yet, travel the world and not struggle to ask for directions to the train. Unfortunately, this is a dream that often seemed impossible to master and so we let go of the idea. Learning a new language is difficult.

Let’s discover winning hacks for learning a new language. We’ll be honest from the start. It won’t be easy. It will take time (how long is up to you). It will be exhausting. You will be tempted to quit. You have to keep going. 7 hacks for learning a new language Talk. Talk. Talk. Yes, talk. It may seem confusing for us to say you should talk in the language that you’re just starting to learn but there is the reason for this. As much as word flash cards have their place in learning a new language, our minds prioritise and absorb more from interactions that have meaning and are rich in emotion. When you talk to someone in the language you’re learning, there are emotions tied to that experience which creates memories…and memories last. Schedule exhaustion Learning a new language requires hours upon hours of repetition. This means a lot of time reading, watching tv shows in that language, and listening to music and podcasts during your gym session or while cooking. Don’t just sign up for English Vertical courses on Alison, but attend the classes, and do the work. Whatever activity you do, incorporate the new language, at your level of understanding, into it. It may seem awkward and unnatural at first, but fully immerse yourself in the target language to give your mind ample opportunities to pick up the language.

Why are you learning a new language? Be clear about your goals including the about of time, resources, and money you will need to accomplish your goal. It could a childhood dream you want to see materialise, or it’s your partner’s native language and you want to bridge the communication gaps in your relationship. Whatever your reason, set clear goals because this is what will keep you going when you’d rather not. Own your mistakes And there will be many. “Mistakes are a fact of life. It is the response to the error that counts,” – Nikki Giovanni. We tend to deny, ignore, or be ashamed of mistakes we make along the learning journey. The truth is mistakes are a part of life and you can’t escape them. So, decide that instead of fighting the mistake, write them down, ask yourself what went wrong and what you can learn from it? Study pronunciation Speaking the target language is a big part of learning. However, many people don’t allow themselves to get to this point because they are insecure about the pronunciation of words and phrases. when you progress to the next level of learning, you will pick up more grammar rules, expand your vocabulary and more.

For many people, it’s an email correspondence tool. What they don’t know, and many people are starting to discover, is that Outlook is a handy tool to help you achieve optimal productivity. In this article, we’re going to explore some Outlook hacks you didn’t know you needed and help you manage your 8-4 (and after-hours) better. What is Microsoft Outlook? Outlook is the preferred email feature for clients to use for sending and receiving emails. It was released in 1997 and over the years, has gone through many versions and feature updates. It forms part of the Microsoft Office suite, which includes Excel and PowerPoint. Outlook also has a free browser-based version but with fewer features. Outlook is plugged into the Cloud and Office 365, allowing clients an integrated system that they can use to collaborate with their team and so much more. Outlook features Every version came with its own notable features that improved upon and revolutionised previous versions and maintained its summit as the business industry standard. Some of these included: No longer sending files as an attachment but sharing documents so that a team can collaborate on one file. Outlook mobile app. The on-the-go feature meant you can work from the palm of your hand and never miss a thing. Calendar to organise and manage your day and focus on the emails that matter most Scheduling assistant that lets you find suitable meeting times and therefore, keeps the whole team in sync with your team. All these features are great right? And have done wonders for yourself and your team. What more is there that you could possibly need and use that you haven’t discovered yet? Keep reading. Outlook hacks you didn’t know you needed Customise events You can add customised events on your calendar. Meaning, you’ll miss a game or the premiere of your favourite show. Go to “add calendar”. Select your events, “sports” or “TV”. Choose the event you want and add you selection. Time zones Many companies have adopted remote work solutions for their employees. This inevitably means that more workers are operating across different time zones – even within teams and across departments. With Outlook, you can have a clear side-by-side view reference of multiple time zones to make scheduling meetings and sending emails easier. Go to “File”. Under “Calendar”, select ‘Time zones”. Check the “show the second time zone” box. You can add three separate time zones in your calendar, and you can decide on these based on where most of your team or clients operate from. Do note that these are only for your calendar view and do not affect where your calendar items are stored, located, or displayed. Schedule emails Sometimes you work late and need to send emails off as you complete your tasks. While this is great for you because you’re getting things done, the recipient may not be as happy to receive notifications at 11 pm or 2 am. Thanks to Outlook, you can schedule when your emails will be sent. Compose your email. Click on the arrow next to “send”. Select “send later” and from the new window, choose your preferred time and date to send the email. Until the scheduled time, you can go into your ‘drafts’ folder and make changes or delete the email if you need to do so. Mute conversations Sometimes you may be included in a long email thread as an FYI but have no contribution to make. And other times, the ‘reply all’ from a bulk email will have you stuck with a constantly pinging inbox notification and nowhere to run. Here’s how to mute these conversations: Open the email and thread you want to mute. Click on the three dots settings feature in the toolbar. Click “Ignore”. Click “OK” to confirm you want to ignore the conversation. “Ignoring” a conversation means you are automatically deleting it so before clicking, be sure it’s really what you want to do. Instead, you can opt to “snooze” a conversation. With this hack, you can decide how long you want the conversation to be in silent mode. It also allows you to go back into the thread and search for the information you need. Quick Steps and Quick Parts This exciting feature allows you to turn three steps into one. If you have certain tasks you do regularly, save time and configure your inbox into quick parts. Go to Home and select ‘Quick Steps’. Select “Create new” and give it a name. Choose what actions you want it to do. With Quick Parts, you can copy the body of an email (or parts that you need) and paste it into the body of future emails. This feature also enables you to save the text as auto text. With your new email, Outlook will suggest the remaining copy of your email and you click “Enter” to insert it into your email. Highlight the copy in the email you want to save and use in future. Go to Insert and click “Quick Parts”. Select “Save selection to Quick Part Gallery”. You can choose a name for the text for easy reference. Save as “quick part” or auto text. These are just a few Outlook hacks can utilise to make your workday easier. Unfortunately, we can’t name them all. Task management, sharing calendars, viewing messages and your way, and keyboard shortboards are just a few more handy ways to boost your productivity.

Then there are good speakers whose voices can hold your attention and will get a standing ovation. And there are those who crumble at the very thought of having to stand in front of an audience and present. Wherever you find yourself on the presentation spectrum, there are small but effective things you can do to ace your presentation. We’re looking at the art of presentations and giving you tips to set you up for your best presentation. What is a presentation? A presentation is defined as a type of communication where a speaker conveys information to an audience. With presentations, you explain a topic, idea, report, system, process, forecast, or similar communications to a group of people. Presentations can be short introductions, speeches, or a lecture to a class, webinars, or now famously, TED Talks. Not every position requires you to give presentations but being able to give presentations remains a valuable skill to develop. 9 tips for giving a good presentation The quality of your presentation is largely impacted and related to your level of preparation. Here are eight valuable tips to use when preparing for and giving a presentation: Start strong. A great opening line will capture your audience’s attention. Craft a strong beginning. Add relevant stories, inspirational quotes, concepts, and examples to give life to your presentation. And close off your presentation on a high note that will leave your listeners wanting more. Prepare. Plan. Practice. Give yourself ample time to prepare your presentation. A last-minute job will look like it was done haphazardly and leaves a bad impression on your audience. Plan your content. What will you speak about? What structure will your presentation follow? What message are you trying to relay to your audience? If speaking in front of an audience makes you nervous, take time to practice in front of a mirror, with a friend, or with a colleague. Have visuals. Not all presentations need visual aids but if you do have them, they must be simple, impactful, and purposeful. Visuals add and complement your oral presentation and should not replace it. Don’t rely on technology. We all know that technology sometimes fails us at the most inopportune times. Test the equipment beforehand if possible and have printed backup documents to share with the audience. While having slides and videos are great, know your content well enough that you can continue if the lights don’t come on for whatever reason. Know your audience. Whom you are speaking to matters as much as what you will be saying to them. Does your audience have any background on the topic you’re presenting? Too much information will be boring and frustrating. Not enough detail will leave them feeling lost. Use your body. A big part of any presentation is the verbal content and the visual aids that accompany it. Another big, yet often ignored part is your non-verbal communication. This relates to your body language, facial expressions, and eye contact. Body language. If possible, move around the floor you are speaking from and don’t remain in one place. Make minimal movements that won’t distract your audience. This shows your engagement in your presentation and opens the space up for your audience to be more involved. Try not to have your arms stiff at your sides or speak with your arms folded. These give off a closed-off impression and will disengage your audience. Stand tall and with your shoulders back to exude confidence (even if you don’t always feel it). Facial expressions. Make use of hand gestures and facial expressions in key moments in your presentation you want to emphasize. This shows excitement and interest in the topic being spoken about. Eye contact. Look at the people you are speaking to. Connect with them through eye contact and make everyone feel seen and included. Make use of the 10-20-30 rule. This concept was first shared by Guy Kawasaki of the global corporation, Apple. Here, he suggests your presentation: Has a maximum of 10 slides. Doesn’t exceed 20 minutes. Use a minimum point size 30 for the font. PowerPoint presentations are visual aids and should not have more information than what you present orally. Ask questions. Ask your audience questions as you go through the presentation and leave time for questions at the end of the presentation. This keeps them engaged in the content. Use your voice. Vary your speed, tone, and pitch throughout your presentation. Give verbal cues: emphasize parts you want them to pay attention to by using phrases like, “this next part is what I want to highlight…”. Speak clearly, concisely, and confidently. The best presentations are those that have something fresh, new, and exciting that hasn’t been seen before. The worst are those that seem robotic, without feeling, or are monotone. When it’s time for you to stand in front of the audience, stand up and speak like you deserve to be there. Own the space. Remain confident in your abilities. Play to your strengths and give a presentation that is authentic to who you are and will leave a lasting impression on those who heard you.","length":5279,"tokens":1077,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"The Art of Presentations","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/the-art-of-presentations","essay_date":"Feb 21, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"There are world-renowned speakers who can orate with confidence, entrance an audience, and speak with the natural ease that makes it seem like they were born to present.

If you’re looking to make a change and enter the tech industry in 2023, I’ve got you covered. In this blog post, I will discuss 5 tips to help make your transition to tech easier and more successful. Keep reading for advice on how to network, learn new skills, and more! 5 Tips to Make a Career Transition into Tech Tip #1: Use Your Network One of the best ways to enter a new industry is by networking. This is especially true for tech jobs in 2023. Word-of-mouth recommendation can help you stand out among other job applicants in such a competitive industry. To get started, consider attending tech events and conferences, joining tech-focused meetups, and using social media networks like LinkedIn to connect with potential mentors, employers, and people in positions you aspire to be in. Some common online platforms to network for tech jobs include: LinkedIn Reddit Quora StackOverflow Not only will this help you build real relationships with people (that can lead to a job), but it will also give you valuable insight into the industry and teach you new skills. Tip #2: Work on Industry-Relevant Projects Having a portfolio of industry-relevant projects is essential for making your transition into tech. Not only will it signify that you’re serious about getting into the field, but it will also show potential employers that you already have some experience in the area. Before you work on any of these projects, analyze the type of businesses of the companies you intend to apply for. Look at what value you can provide to their business and determine what would catch a hiring manager’s eye. For example, if you’re planning to be a web developer in healthcare, you can create a website project with the design and elements suited to the needs of a healthcare business. Or, if you’re looking to be a marketing data analyst, you can work on a data analytics project that analyzes the web traffic of a business and present them in an eye-catching dashboard. Tip #3: Create An Outstanding Portfolio To showcase your projects in a professional manner, you’ll need to create an outstanding portfolio site. You can do this online with a variety of tools like WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace. Your portfolio should contain samples of your previous work, links to projects you’ve worked on and/or written about, and any articles or blog posts you have published. Additionally, include any awards or certificates that prove relevant skills in the tech industry. Many hiring managers have a look at your portfolio for relevant experience, so a portfolio is essential for all tech jobs. Ensure that your portfolio is up-to-date and showcases your best skills! Tip #4: Consider Joining a Tech Startup Joining a tech startup can be an amazing way to gain experience in the industry. Not only will you have access to the latest technologies, but you will get many chances to learn a broad base of skills. For example, if you’re going to work as a software engineer, you’ll have the opportunity to work on the full stack of software development, from back-end programming to front-end design. Additionally, you can take part in marketing and business decisions, giving you a more holistic view of how tech businesses succeed. In a startup environment, you may also be able to start your own projects or create entire products from scratch. Plus, you’ll get the opportunity to work with like-minded people and learn about the business side of tech companies. Instead of transitioning into big tech companies, joining a startup can be a good steppingstone—for gaining experience and building a reputation in the industry. Tip #5: Take Advantage of Online Resources Aside from networking and working on your own projects, there are plenty of online resources to help you make the transition into tech. For example, YouTube has a wealth of tutorials covering almost every aspect of tech—from coding languages to design tools. Additionally, Alison offers many courses in technology-related topics such as app development, data analytics, and cloud computing. There are many reasons to learn from such online courses, but where the true value of such courses comes in is through the structured learning environment it provides. With the guidance of video tutorials and practical exercises, you can learn step-by-step and ensure that you’re on track with the right skills. Final Thoughts Making the transition into tech is no easy task. It requires time, dedication, hard work, and industry knowledge. But, with the right strategy and resources, you can transition into tech and start your career in this ever-evolving field. Take full advantage of online platforms such as LinkedIn and Reddit to network, create a portfolio of industry-relevant projects, join a tech startup, and take advantage of online tutorials to master the skills required for your job. With enough determination and effort, you can make your transition into tech successful! Ready to make your transition?

Millions of people are reaping the rewards of being an affiliate marketer. Affiliate programmes are one of the top ways you can earn a second passive income stream from anywhere in the world. If you’ve just started your journey as an affiliate marketer in 2023 or are looking for ways to increase your revenue, you’ve come to the right place. However, before the additional income starts flowing, you need to learn the skills, techniques, and tools of the trade. Here are a few tools every affiliate marketer should use to be a successful and sustainable affiliate. Affiliate marketing tools When you have the right affiliate marketing tools, you can collect relevant information, track your income and visitors, build high ranking websites and landing pages, and more. Canva Canva is your easy-to-use graphic design and publishing tool. Not every affiliate has design skills or the budget to pay a freelance designer for posts, so this comes in handy for affiliates and content creators. Content with images and videos get more views than simple posts with just text. With Canva, you can design beautiful posters, thumbnails, social media images, presentations, eBooks, infographics and more, making your posts attractive to your audience and giving them a wider reach. Tiny PNG Size matters. Especially when it comes to photos that take forever to load. Visitors to your page will quickly log out and search elsewhere. That’s a potential customer you’ve lost simply because of a slow site. Tiny PNG takes your big PNG and image files and compresses them without affecting the photo quality. This helps you use less data and frees up more space to save more photos on your device. BuzzSumo Buzzsumo is a handy research and monitoring tool for affiliate marketers. This tool helps you research content across the internet and provides useful metrics that every affiliate needs. It’s great because you can use it across different social media platforms including Reddit, Twitter, and Pinterest. Furthermore, you can use their content discovery tool to help you search for fresh content ideas and stay ahead of the rest. Grammarly Grammarly is your go-to writing and editing tool for error-free copy. Like the name suggests, this tool checks your grammar, punctuation, spelling, and other common copy mistakes we make. It can also pick up words spelt correctly but used in the wrong context. This is great for multilingual affiliates who want to reach an English-speaking audience but it’s not their first language. SEMRush SEMRush is a digital marketing tool that gives you insight into what your competitors (other affiliates) are doing with their campaigns. It allows you to discover patterns and trends to help you modify your content and promotions. Although it comes at a price, it also helps you generate leads, and provides essential SEO metrics as well as backlink and site audits. AnyTrack AnyTrack is another conversion tracking tool that’s popular among affiliates. It works with Google Ads, Facebooks Ads, Bing Ads, and SEO campaigns and utilises Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel to track your conversion and sync them.

It’s best used for on-page optimisation and therefore, ensuring your blog is search engine friendly and your website ranks high on search engines globally. Your SEO ranking is coded green, orange and red, which guides you on how SEO-friendly your content is and suggests changes to improve your content. Buffer We love social media. It’s endless hours of fun, engagement, and interactions with your friends and followers until it’s not. Affiliate marketers who have multiple accounts across platforms may start to lose the fun of social media when it begins to feel like work. This happens when you’re juggling content, schedules, post formats and more. Buffer takes this stress away and collates your different accounts in one place, making it easier to manage and saving you time. Here, you can create and schedule posts across your platforms and leave them to go live when you go out and do what you do best.

Or someone. Organisations carry the same responsibility. In companies, accounting is the language of all business. Every business needs to be honest about its numbers. No fledging. No inflating. No exaggerating. Good accounting helps a business make decisions and plays a critical role in the planning and controlling processes. To understand how companies balance books and what it takes to be an accountant, we sat down with a qualified Chartered Accountant, Nhyira, to learn more. Meet Nhyira Tell us a bit about your background. My name is Nhyira Asante (p. s. you don’t say it the way it is spelt) and I’m a Chartered Accountant from South Africa currently working as an investment analyst. What made you decide to go into accounting? The age-old question – well I’m in this specific field via my mom’s direction. She always wanted to be an accountant but didn’t get to be one until later on in life, so she encouraged me to pursue it. When I saw the stars aligning in terms of academics, I gave it a full-hearted “go” and I’ve often looked back since then (I jest, it’s a pretty fulfilling career). Understanding accountancy For those who don’t know, what does an accountant do? An accountant essentially works at making sure the financial side of a business is kept in check by recording transactional information and then providing insight into what all the numbers mean. What courses does it take to become an accountant? What courses did you study? I went to Wits University in Johannesburg (University of the Witwatersrand) and studied a Bachelor of Accounting Sciences as my undergrad and then a year of postgrad for my Certificate in the Theory of Accounting (CTA). What additional certifications, exams, and memberships have you had to complete as part of your career journey? As soon as CTA was done, I wrote my first Board exam which is a technical exam, and thereafter my second and final Board exam which is a more “practical” exam. Are there different types of accountants? Yes, we can break it down by qualification. There are professional accountants, chartered accounts, chartered certified accountants, management accountants, etc. All have a similar focus on providing accurate financial information to assess a business’s performance and forecast future performance. Then there are the roles that accountants perform as well – they can be bookkeepers, financial managers, CFOs, investment analysts, entrepreneurs – any number of things. What essential skills should every accountant have for success? The key is to have a good handle on the organisation and pay attention to detail. Do aspiring accountants need to be good at math to succeed? Fortunately, yes otherwise people would sue us consistently and constantly. What qualities and traits do you need to succeed as an accountant? The job is immensely challenging. You need to have the ability to persevere no matter the challenges. What are the daily challenges you face as an accountant? Usual stress of meeting near-term deadlines most efficiently and accurately. In what sectors can accountants work and where are they most sought after? Luckily, we can work across many sectors – as long as there is a need for someone to understand financial information there will be a need for accountants. What are some misconceptions about being an accountant? That we are boring, stingy, penny pushers that people should ignore. The life of an accountant What does a typical day in your life look like? My journey is a little different from a typical accountant’s – I work in an investment bank so my day-to-day involves covering admin and transactional points that may arise on one of the deals (selling and buying corporate businesses and providing other strategic advice to company leaders) I handle – this includes preparing materials, taking notes, valuing companies etc. When you started on this journey, what were your vision and mission? My vision was to help people with their businesses and financing so entrepreneurs would be able to execute their dreams and visions. My mission also slowly became about debunking the information barrier that exists between people who are well versed in how to work in a corporate, investing etc. and those that don’t have access to that information. What are some of the daily habits you do that contribute to your success? I try to take notes of everything I need to do, to help me keep track (I’ve always heard that a short pencil is better than a long memory) Motivating and challenging team members towards a greater common goal I exercise integrity and try to be reliable which results in more trust in the system for a more conducive work environment. What’s the biggest sacrifice you’ve had to make, and would you make it again if necessary? The biggest sacrifice is an ongoing motif in my current role – my job is quite intense, and as a result, I’ve had to sacrifice quality time with family to cater to my job. Challenges of being an accountant Have you experienced any failures or setbacks as an accountant and what lessons did you learn from that experience? Definitely, in the words of Donnie McClurkin – “we don’t fall, we get up” (paraphrased). I had quite the challenge in my post-grad year but managed to pass what is a dreaded year for most accounting students. What do you know now about being an accountant that you didn’t know before you started your career? Accountant roles post qualification are so wide and varied – it enables you to do anything you would want to do. Who inspires you and pushes you to keep going? I want to build a more beautiful life for my parents – the idea that I will be able to make that happen day one day keeps me going. Is work-life balance something you can achieve in your job as an accountant? In general – it is within reach however in my current role, it’s rare. What are some non-negotiable things you practice in your role? Preparing for meetings Having a post-debrief session with yourself to understand what was discussed in a meeting (Especially when there’s new information you’ve been exposed to) Being diligent and excellent in the work I submit to the team (to the best of my ability) Do you have any apps or tools you use to stay organised? I use Microsoft Outlook. What words of encouragement or advice would you give someone looking to become an accountant? Know your why (your purpose for pursuing this career) – once that is established and unlikely to change, you’ll be able to contextualise what you’re giving up getting your dream and decide whether it’s worth it or not. Always practise gratitude for any opportunity that is presented to you – it opens countless other doors and opportunities. Accounting for something When working with clients, what are the easiest and most challenging things you must deal with? Clients are easy to engage with generally, and it’s fun to win them over. They can also be quite slow in providing responses that you would need to action your own challenging work. How important is teamwork in this field and how do you ensure you build a strong team? Teamwork as in most fields is important – building a strong team takes intentionality in building trust and a safe space for team members to share their knowledge and ask questions. What are the possible career paths for someone who has completed (or is about to complete) their accounting qualification? Moving overseas using your qualification, financial manager, investment analyst, entrepreneur etc. The proudest moment in your career so far? Qualifying as a chartered accountant. Think you have what it takes to help companies keep accounts? Take our free workplace personality assessment below and find out who you are and why you do the things you do.

You start to think if eating salads and drinking eight glasses of water is the sum of everything healthy. Health is about more than food. And habits are not all ‘bad’. We are made up of good and bad habits. Some we live out consciously. Other habits are so ingrained in us, they’re part of who we are. Biting your nails when you’re nervous. Brushing your teeth before washing your face. Praying before your feet hit the ground in the morning. Not all habits are created equal. Keep reading to learn the healthy habits you need for success this year. What are habits? Here’s the thing about healthy habits. They are learned and formed in the same way as unhealthy habits – through practice. Healthy habits are the different things you do every day, or that have a positive impact on your physical and mental wellbeing. Habits are the repetitive behaviours you do, often without thinking, that make up a part of your life. The other great thing about habits is that because they are learned, you can train yourself to develop good habits, and break bad habits. Types of habits Generally, we categorise habits as being good or bad. We can group habits into mental, physical, or emotional categories. Mental: intellectual habits have to do without cerebral capacities. This related to how we reason, logic, how observant and perceptive we are and how we make decisions (or taking time to consider all options and consequences) Physical: these are also known as motor habits and are associated with our bodies and muscular activities. Emotional: these habits have to do with our character and look at our countenance, how trusting we are, helpful, time management, and tidiness are some examples. In different settings, these habits are more pronounced. In other situations, we have to work hard at living out the good habits, when everything in you leans toward doing the opposite. Once you recognise your strengths in each type of habit, you position yourself to strengthen them where they serve you. Why forming healthy habits is important At the start of each new year, we write our goals for the year ahead. Intertwined in these goals are the daily habits that will lay the foundation for change and success. Because habits are often instinctive and happen automatically, they reduce the brain power needed to make certain decisions. When you form healthy habits, you enjoy a healthier longer life and one without the unwanted and often debilitating health issues that come with an unhealthy lifestyle. Good habits increase your quality of life Habits help us perform efficiently. You are rewarded with a healthy sense of pride and achievement for accomplishing something Creating habits help reduce stress and anxiety Healthy habits provide you with structure and order, helping you develop a sense of control and daily task management. Healthy habits for success A 2009 study published in the European Journal of Social Psychology said that it takes roughly about 18 to 254 days to form a new habit. This study went on to say that it will take an average of 66 days before the new behaviour becomes automatic. Master the art of self-discipline. You won’t always feel motivated or in the mood to do something. This is where self-discipline comes in handy. Train your mind to be strong to push through when the feelings are low because your mind stays on the end goal. Remove distractions. Make use of apps that switch off your social media between certain hours or limit how much time you spend on social media daily. Download (and then use) apps like BreakFree (Android and iOS), Moment, Social Fever, and StayFree to name a few that are aimed at monitoring your phone usage habits and turning off your notifications. You’d be surprised how that notification ping can trigger a trip down the social media rabbit hole. Do one hard/small thing every day. Deciding you don’t want to be late or in a rush to the office every day and be the first one in can seem challenging when you think of the morning rush and traffic. One small thing can be getting into the habit of selecting your clothes the night before. Laying them out and making sure they’re ironed, fit and you have a matching tie or shirt will save you 15 minutes in the morning. 15 extra minutes every day adds up to hours of productivity and focus. Take ownership of your life. It sounds harsh but the truth is, no one is coming to save you or hand you the dream bod or give you that coveted managerial position. Go out and take the bull by the horns if you will. Get out of the victim mentality of “if only…then”. Decide on the life you want, how badly you want it and take the necessary steps to get you there. Yes, the economy is unstable, and people make terrible choices that impact you, as far as it is in your control, take power of what you can. Learn a new skill. The biggest investment you can make is in yourself. The return on investment is priceless because no one can ever take away what you have learned and acquired when it comes to skills. You have untapped potential within you and all you need to do is invest your time in learning and upskilling yourself. Learn a new language, listen to podcasts, read, sign up for free courses on Alison…learn. Whether you’ve mastered your healthy habits or you’re still working through breaking the bad habits, you’ll never change your life until you change something you do daily.

And we’re diving right into it and exploring 10 reasons you should join the 5 A. M. club. The 5 A. M. club 20 years ago, best-selling author Robin Sharma released a book, The 5 A. M. Club, to global acclaim. In his book, he shared the concept of how getting up at 5 A. M. is the difference between the ordinary and the extraordinary. According to Sharma, a 5 A. M. wake-up allows you to complete a set of 20/20/20. 20 minutes of intense exercise, 20 minutes to reflect on your goals, and another 20 minutes to learn a new skill. The 20/20/20 technique is a method to optimise your productivity. How the 20/20/20 looks If you’re like most of us, your reflex will be to toss your alarm clock (not your phone) across the room when it blares at 5 A. M. Very normal reaction. But resist the urge. Keep in mind the purpose behind the early start – to be the best, most productive person you can be. 05:00-05:20 – exercise 05:20-05:40 – pause and reflect 05:40-06:00 – read and/or learn something new “Early to bed, and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.” —Benjamin Franklin 7 reasons to join the 5 A. M. club Let’s be real for a minute. Our lives are busy. From the moment we wake up until we go to bed at night, we live jumping from one task and responsibility to the next. With little to no time dedicated to accomplishing key projects – well. Or even giving time to things that excite us, challenge us, and make us feel alive. Enter the 5 A. M. club mentality. No distractions. At 5 A. M., very little is happening in the world. Your phone isn’t buzzing with notifications, the kids are still sleeping (if you’re lucky), and few people are awake. This quiet time is the perfect time to tap into your brain and do or begin working towards one thing uninterrupted. Creates a routine. Our bodies have a 24-hour internal clock, the circadian rhythm, that helps us regulate our physical and mental functioning. Our mind and body serve us best when we are well-rested. A consistent sleep-wake schedule gives you more energy to get through the day and get things done. Time to plan. The extra hours you get in the morning allow you to plan your day ahead – without the rush and madness that tends to come with lateness. Exercise. While Sharma’s rule calls for “intense exercise”, find something that works for you. The key is to get your body moving, the happy hormones flowing, and your body primed for the day. A Pilates class, walking your dog, going for a jog or a session at the gym, the burst of energy will do wonders for your body. Prepare. Dedicate the other 20 minutes of your 5 A. M. start to reflect on your goals. These can be your daily, weekly, or even monthly goals. Are you on track to achieving them? What can you do today that will get you closer to meeting them? What did you do yesterday that you can build on today? And how can you prepare for the day ahead in a way that will get you where you need to be? Discipline. Anyone can wake up at 5 A. M. tomorrow. And keep that up for a week or two. To do something when everything in you screams not to, that’s where change happens. Waking up at 5 A. M. requires discipline and digging deep when the urge to sleep is strong. The discipline of repetition for months and years on end takes stamina, mental and physical strength, and an unwavering commitment to succeeding. “Discipline is choosing between what you want now, and what you want most.” – Abraham Lincoln. Healthy habits. Waking up at 5 A. M. means you’ll most likely go to bed earlier. This means you’ll “switch off” and reduce the late-night indulgences we’ve become accustomed to – think late-night snacking, bingeing on series, and incessant scrolling in bed. The 5 A. M. club, by default, encourages developing healthier habits that contribute to your success. No, waking up at 5 A. M. is not easy. But then again, nothing worthwhile ever is easy. And no, not all will become CEOs or billionaires, but that’s not what it’s about at the end of the day. Life is about living to your full potential, being present in any and every moment, doing good (to yourself and others), being productive, creative, and leaving the world better than you found it. It’s being alive. And what better way to achieve this than by getting the most out of every day? Set your alarm and join the 5 A. M. club. Your dreams won’t wait for you.","length":4766,"tokens":1152,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"7 Reasons to Join the 5 A.M.

The mentor-mentee relationship is regarded as critical for both parties. For the mentor, it’s an act of service and giving back to aspiring leaders. For mentees, it’s a rich ground for learning the secrets to success. Like all relationships, finding the perfect person is not always easy. Keep reading to learn all about finding a mentor and establishing a relationship for success. What is a mentor? A mentor is defined as a counselor or a guide. This is someone who offers you support, gives advice, and provides guidance in either your personal life or in your career growth and development. A mentor will invest their time, energy, and resources to get to know you and walk with you through the stages and challenges you face. As your mentor, they will use their own experiences, lessons learned, and wisdom gained to help you overcome these challenges and grow into the best version of yourself. The benefits of having a good mentor The reason why mentorship is so highly regarded by successful people is because of the many benefits it brings to the life and career of a mentee. Access. When you have a mentor, you have front row access to an inspiring mind who has the knowledge and experience of the world you want to navigate. A mentor has access to information, contacts and networks that can otherwise be difficult to get to. New perspectives. A mentor provides you with a new way of looking at problems and dealing with issues. From their experience, they can offer fresh perspectives and offer insights into career challenges and solutions. It’s like you’ve travelled the world, without getting on the plane. Leadership. As a mentee, you reap from the wells of wisdom and sit under someone with valuable leadership qualities. Through their guidance, you will hone your leadership skills and are better able to take on roles, tasks, and responsibilities you may have missed – and carry them well. Network. Another benefit of having a mentor is that through their networks, you can build and grow your own connections and build relationships with key thought leaders, decision-makers, and professionals in the industry that will help you reach your goals. As they sharpen and mould you into becoming your best self, you too, as a mentee, enrich the life of a mentor by giving them the opportunity to lead and create an environment where others can grow and flourish. Qualities of a good mentor It’s often said that you are most like the people you surround yourself with. This carries more weight in your mentor-mentee relationship because your mentor will be pouring all of who they are into who you are and want to be. Thus, they need to have the type of qualities you too would like to grow and nourish. Enthusiastic. A mentor should be excited to mentor you. Their desire and passion to help is evident in how they present themselves to you. Active listener. Mentorship is a symbiotic relationship where both parties benefit. Your mentor should be willing to listen to you and not solely focused on doling out advice without considering your needs and progress. Honest. This is crucial in a mentor-mentee relationship because honest feedback forms the backbone of a good mentorship. Your mentor needs to be able to give good, productive feedback that will help cultivate your potential and improve in various areas. Knowledgeable. A good mentor should have a relevant background and expertise in their field. This is important because their knowledge of the industry, and landscape is what you need to excel in your career. They will have a wealth of experience to impart on you. Respectful. How a person sees, values, and treats another human being, regardless of their station in life says a lot about their character. As such, you need a mentor who treats you and conducts themselves in a respectful manner. How to find a good mentor There’s a lot of value in finding the right mentor. You can’t just pick someone you like based on their style or taste. You must be deliberate and intentional about finding a good mentor, so you get out of the relationship what it’s designed for. Know your goals. There’s a famous saying, “if you aim at nothing, you’ll hit it.” It’s important to know what it is you want to achieve and accomplish. The more specific you are about what your goals are, the easier it will be to find the right mentor. You also don’t want to find a willing mentor but waste their time because you haven’t set down a clear vision for what you want. Research. Your mentor doesn’t have to be on the front cover of a magazine or have millions in the bank. In most cases, you have people in your professional circle, or they know someone who has what you’re looking for in a mentor. Look around you. Your boss, a former professor, a department head, or in your friendship circle. Study who you admire, what qualities, traits, and roles you aspire to have and explore if they will be the right match for you. Reach out. Once you’ve identified who you believe can be a good fit for you, make your approach. Invite them for a coffee (if they have time) or schedule a meeting to make the request. If you don’t know them directly or have a standing relationship with them, ask a mutual acquaintance to make the introduction and establish common ground. When you do meet them, be confident about who you are, what you want, how you see them contributing to your growth, what your challenges and hopes are. TIPS: Be prepared for a “no” if they are too busy and can’t commit to mentoring you. Be honest. Be upfront about the time commitment to the relationship, sacrifices that will be required, and any stumbling blocks you foresee getting in the way. Have your elevator pitch ready. If this is your one shot at meeting and making this request, make it a memorable one. Leave a lasting impression. Finding a mentor should be organic. A forced relationship will likely result in unmet expectations and provide little value. What everyone agrees on is this: regardless of how long the mentor-mentee relationship lasts, finding the right mentor and forming that solid relationship can be a powerful, life-changing tool for your career. With the right mentor backing you, you are well placed to discover new career opportunities, find a work-life balance, and do more for others than you thought you could. Your next step…pay it forward.","length":6517,"tokens":1369,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Finding a Mentor","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/finding-a-mentor","essay_date":"Feb 1, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"Ask anyone what the key to success is and chances are they’ll tell you that finding a mentor helped catapult their career from the little league to the big stage.

Not many of us are bold and courageous enough to leave a stable income and put our faith in ourselves and our business idea. What we can be sure of is that becoming an entrepreneur is not as quick and simple as handing in your resignation letter. Often, you’ll have to bear the brunt of owning your own business with sleepless nights, tight budgets until you make a profit, and doing the job of several people until you rent an office space and hire a team. To find out more about being your own boss, we spoke to the founder of The Light Candles, Makutu Tshivula, about his journey into entrepreneurship and the lessons learned along the way. Getting to know Makutu Tshivula Tell us a bit about your background. I’m Makatu Tshivhula, born and bred in Soweto. I am a psychology graduate, graduating in 2019. I was unemployed for a year after graduation, and I decided to start my own business and not wait for a job to come. Venturing into entrepreneurship What made you decide to go into entrepreneurship? Unemployment was what pushed me into becoming an entrepreneur. I decided to get into the Candle Industry because there’s a gap in the market that convinced me to actually go for it and be an entrepreneur. Where did the idea of running your own business come from? From my parents. Since I was young, they have always sold various things all their life, from fruits and vegetables to clothes to support us and put food on the table. How would you define entrepreneurship? Entrepreneurship for me is identifying a gap in the market and having the belief in yourself and faith in God that you could become successful from that gap in the market that you are trying to close. When you started on this journey, what was your vision and mission? My vision was to become the biggest candle-manufacturing company in the continent of Africa. The mission was to execute this by having the best candles ever and providing the best service to all my clients, regardless of where they are on the continent. What drives you? God. My parents and self-belief. Skills and qualities that every entrepreneur should have What essential skills should every entrepreneur have for success? Persistence, salesmanship and patience, but overall, the spirit of not giving up, especially at times when things aren’t looking up. What qualities do you need to succeed? There’s a lot because there are many layers to being an entrepreneur. But for me, hard work, faith and consistency. The realities of entrepreneurship What’s the hardest about being an entrepreneur? The stress and pressure of it. Everything falls on you. The stress of having to worry about every important decision you need to make. Have you experienced any failures or setbacks as an entrepreneur and what lessons did you learn from that experience? Yes, I have, I learnt that I need to do more research before taking decisions on anything that has to do with the business. Is there anything you wish you could have done differently when you started? No, I believe everything I’ve done needs to be done to get me to where I am today. Everything I’ve gone through; I see as a lesson. How do you plan and prepare for your future in an unstable economic climate? By being consistent with the work that I do. My products and services with customers, doing the daily work and having faith that God didn’t bring me this far just to leave me where I am. What does success look like to you? Having the ability to do whatever you want, whenever you want to, being content with what you have and knowing that there’s more to come. What was the most difficult part of making the transition to becoming an entrepreneur? Having the discipline to do work. When you’re running your own business and you realise it all depends on you and especially because you are not reporting to anyone, it’s easy to procrastinate a lot. The danger with that is that it becomes hard to catch up. A day in the life of an entrepreneur What does a typical day in your life look like? Gym in the morning. Then I head to the shop – either to manufacture or do some admin work. And then I dedicate time to finding ways to improve sales. Is there such a thing as a work-life balance for an entrepreneur? It depends on what stage of entrepreneurship you’re on. In the beginning stages of the business, there is no such. But as the business grows, you learn to put systems in place that will help you balance work and life. What are some of the daily habits you do that contribute to your success? I start every day by praying. To keep going, I keep envisioning things that seem impossible in the beginning. What’s the biggest sacrifice you’ve had to make, and would you make it again if necessary? Letting go of some habits such as hanging around with friends every day. What words of encouragement or advice would you give someone looking to become their own boss? Start small but think big. In anything you put your mind to believe that it will one day be bigger than you. What are some of the biggest/most common mistakes novice entrepreneurs make? Not being able to separate business money from your money. Building from the ground up What are some misconceptions about being an entrepreneur? That it’s the quickest way of becoming a millionaire. What are some non-negotiable things you practice in your business? Praying every day when I enter the business and always greeting customers with a smile. How do you market your business? I’m still relatively small so I don’t have a budget for big marketing. So, for now, it’s through social media and word of mouth. Any tips for building up a team? People you can trust with your life, people that can align to the vision you have for the business. Most satisfying moment as an entrepreneur that keeps you going. Customer feedback and being recognised by people who aren’t even your customers. Who do you look up to and why? Who is your biggest source of inspiration as an entrepreneur? I look up to God because I believe He brought me to this world to fulfil a certain purpose which is to bring light both metaphorically and literally. My biggest source of Inspiration is Lekau Sehoana, the tenacity and persistence he has when it comes to entrepreneurship are unmatched. Every entrepreneur’s journey is unique. The lessons, sacrifices, challenges, and reasons for taking that next step are different for every entrepreneur. What we can be sure of and have learned from the young entrepreneur lighting up South Africa is you need discipline and faith – in yourself, your product, and for Makutu, in God, that the dream is worth chasing. That hard work will pay off. And if you keep seeking inspiration and means to constantly improve your business, the only way is up. If you believe entrepreneurship is the next step for you but aren’t sure where to start, head on over to our entrepreneurship career hub for tips, information and recommended courses you can take to kick-start your business.","length":7053,"tokens":1492,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Industry Spotlight: Entrepreneurship","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/industry-spotlight-entrepreneurship","essay_date":"Jan 27, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"Many of us dream of leaving the 9 to 5 life to become our own bosses as successful entrepreneurs.

Often, you’ll have to bear the brunt of owning your own business with sleepless nights, tight budgets until you make a profit, and doing the job of several people until you rent an office space and hire a team. To find out more about being your own boss, we spoke to the founder of The Light Candles, Makutu Tshivula, about his journey into entrepreneurship and the lessons learned along the way.

Big cars. Small cars. Compact vehicles. SUVs. FWD. Luxury cars or your entry-level models. There is a lot of technical and electrical work that happens on the garage floor that ensures you have a smooth drive. This month, we’re shining the Alison Publisher Spotlight under the hood on all things automotive with Steven Liguori. Introduction and Background Please share with our learners a bit about your background. My Dad was an automotive technician and I enjoyed working with him on family and friend’s cars. I took a two-year Master Automotive Technician course from National Radio Institute in Washington D. C. and an Electronics Technology course from Cleveland Institute of Electronics in Ohio. These courses gave me a solid foundation in both automotive and electronics that allowed me to advance in the automotive field. I received my first opportunity in 1979 at an Oldsmobile Dealership as an entry level technician. I worked 26 years at several General Motors dealerships as an automotive technician, shop foreman, quality control technician and in house trainer of new technicians. In 2005, an injury to my hands led me to pursue a teaching career at an automotive school in New York. In 2015, I semi-retired and moved to Florida with my wife, Susan where I started creating online courses. You had a long career as a Certified Master Automotive Technician for over 35 Years. What made you venture into becoming an automotive instructor? An injury to my hands led me to pursue a teaching career. I found that I loved helping others learn and I always looked for easier ways to explain a concept to fellow technicians and customers. I became a certified A. S. E. (Automotive Service Excellence) Master Technician in 1983 and recertify every 5 years. Publishing on Alison Please tell us more about your passion for teaching and coaching. I have had a passion for coaching and teaching for the longest time. This passion has carried over to my teaching where I am always looking for a better way to explain something so I can reach more students. What made you decide to create courses on Alison? Zainab Qaiserani and the Publisher Development Team invited me to host my courses on Alison. com. I researched Alison, and also found someone I knew in Germany that already had his courses on Alison. He recommended Alison saying he felt my courses would do well there. What do you enjoy most about publishing on Alison? Publishing on Alison is different than most other education sites. They have a team member review and assist with grammar, format and course descriptions. After this process, it’s a better product than the initial course, and for that, hats off to Alison. What lessons have you learned as a self-publisher on Alison? As a self-publisher on Alison, I have learned to choose better language and syntax for titles, lessons, and topic descriptions. How has being a self-publisher on Alison changed your life? The easy answer is that Alison. com has provided another source of income to my income stream. Alison has allowed me to reach more people interested in automotive electrical. As a teacher, the students are the reward. Courses on Alison Tell us a bit more about your courses on Alison. My courses on Alison. com are automotive electrical related. I currently offer: a beginner course that teaches automotive students how to Diagnose Basic Car Electrical Problems Using Wiring Diagrams. The Automotive Starting System Diagnosis course explains the fundamentals of starter operation and its purpose. The course then dives into starter electrical schematics to explain a process of elimination approach that will lead students to a successful diagnostic conclusion. My three Ohm’s law courses round out my current offerings. I cover Series Circuits and Ohm’s law, Parallel Circuits and Ohm’s law and Series Parallel Circuits and Ohm’s law each in its own course. We provide many practice examples in each course, and we explain a step-by-step method that works for all three types of circuits. What do people enjoy most about your courses? Students all over the world have told me my courses have finally allowed them to understand automotive electrical. Many of my students have commented that I have helped them pass their electric A. S. E. (Automotive Service Excellence) certification test. One student in India said that I taught him more in my 2-hour beginner electrical course than he learned in a 2-month classroom program he paid for. They like the simple but relative explanations and the animated examples. Who should take your courses? My courses are for anyone with an interest in automotive electrical that wants to learn a new skill. Learning automotive, electrical and electronics How can a learner, with no technical background but a love and interest in cars prepare themselves before enrolling in your course. To prepare for my courses, a student could search for a few short videos on automotive electrical basics and how to use a multimeter. My courses will then help demystify and clear up the parts that they did not comprehend. Automotive is quite hands on. How can learners master precision throughout their studies online? Engine rebuilding and replacement, repairing or replacing steering gears, brake components, and maintenance services are very hands on. You need to: take some type of hands-on course, have guidance from someone with experience, or have practiced working with tools, taking things apart and putting them back together. With that said, a student can master the fundamentals, the theory of operation and the most important skill of all these days which is researching symptoms and finding the correct diagnostic charts, schematics, and assembly guides to help the repairs they are looking to do. What skills and qualities would help an individual succeed in this field? Computer skills to find the information needed to diagnose and repair what they are working on is key. If the student intends to do the repair work themselves, they need the ability to use your hands, hand tools, air tools and electrical power tools. The other missing link is the ‘I want to find the answer’ quality. The challenge of diagnosing something, the detective mentality. The person that keeps playing a video game until they find a solution to beat a certain level and move on to a new one is a good candidate. The person who is afraid to try will tend to struggle in the automotive industry. e-Learning in automotive How does e-learning change face-to-face training? E-learning is a great compliment to face-to-face training, especially for students that can focus on the online course they take without being distracted. As time passes, more schools will incorporate both e-learning and face-to-face training into their course offerings. How should learner’s approach electrical and electronics systems? Learners need to realise that the electrical and electronics arena of automotive is less ‘take apart and look for broken parts’, and more understanding how something works. Additionally, learners must find out what specific symptom is present, and then use the proper diagnostic information and tools to narrow down the amount of hands-on work needed to find and repair the problem. Getting into the automotive space What are the biggest challenges learners face within the automotive space? The biggest challenge in the automotive space today is having the tools and resources needed to diagnose what you are working on. If the right information is not available, new and experienced technicians tend to guess parts. I have received many calls for help where the tech has many components apart and says, “I replaced this and this and this and it still does the same thing.” The answer is they need to put everything back together and start again, identify the symptom, and reproduce it if possible. Then, use the proper schematic and the description and operation sheet to narrow down the possible causes. What tips can you give someone looking to get started in this field? Take some online courses or attend a technical school and look for an entry level job in the field. Dealerships are always looking for lube techs and lot attendants that can get you in the door. Once in, don’t hang with the people that sit around when there is nothing to do. Look for the guy that is working and ask if he or she needs help. Electrical cars are becoming popular. What’s the future of the automotive space? There has been a big push for electric cars of late. There are benefits to electric vehicles for sure, but there are also consequences. The processes for making the batteries for electric cars and the disposal of these batteries after their useful life may negate some of the benefits of having them. The other problem is that the amount of trained high voltage technicians at a car dealership right now is very small compared to the number of technicians that will be needed if the forecast for the use of electric vehicles pans out. The good news for technicians is that if they want to become a high voltage electric vehicle technician, this may become a lucrative venture. Last thoughts What words of advice would you give someone who would like to become a publisher on Alison? For someone looking to become a publisher on Alison I would recommend they have a friend or colleague watch their courses and read their copy and get feedback before trying to publish on Alison. A raw course will take a lot of correcting and modification then one that is organized and has good titles, descriptions and content. How has been your most important lesson or discovery when it comes to online education programmes? My most important lesson since starting to create online programs is you never know which courses will be the most popular and productive. I may think it’s a great course, but if nobody is watching it, it doesn’t matter. What career paths are available for someone interested in pursuing your courses? Taking my courses are a great start for anyone looking to learn the basics of automotive electrical. Knowing electrical and of course having some hands-on ability can help get you started in an automotive repair facility or car dealership. My Ohm’s law courses, while great for automotive, are even a great fit for new engineering students. What challenges/limitations can one expect in these fields? There are challenges in every field or job that you may explore. In automotive repair, poor management, lack of equipment, pressure to finish cars with no time to finish them are a few examples. We live in a fast-paced world and sometimes the stress of the repair industry jobs can be a burden. The good news is it is also a very rewarding field to be in. I take pride in repairing cars and trucks over the years as well as teaching new students to head in the same direction. Looking ahead What can Alison look forward to from you in the coming year to two? I plan to enrich my Alison course offerings with some new courses on automotive electrical. Courses on specific automotive systems are in the works as well as extra intermediate and advanced courses. Any last words, advice, or wisdom you’d like to share with our learners? A few last words for Alison learners. Whatever you do in life, I wish you the best. Follow your heart and set a goal for yourself in whatever field of study you choose to explore. I am privileged to be one of the Alison publishers and if my courses can help you get where you want to go, it is my honour to be a part of your success. If these insights have revved your interests and you want to tinker with wheels, engines, and circuits, enroll in any of the free courses in automotive electrical, and electronics.","length":11766,"tokens":2345,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Alison Publisher Spotlight: Steven Liguori","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-publisher-spotlight-steven-liguori","essay_date":"Jan 26, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"Everyday thousands of cars line the highways.

Despite its unrivaled beauty, the dramatic landscapes, ocean views, rich history and culture, South Africa remains a largely unequal society. A reality perpetuated by the broken and unequal education system. The start of the new school year brings back into focus the looming gap that’s prevalent in the education sector in SA. Below, we explore this a bit further and discuss where students and educators can go from here. The South African education system In South Africa, every child has a basic right to education. It’s compulsory for children aged seven to 15 years to attend school and receive an education. The education system is divided into three levels, general education and training, further education and training, and higher education and training. A 2020 report by Amnesty International reflected on the dire state of the education system. In rural areas and many schools in more urban neighbourhoods have crumbling infrastructure, classrooms are overcrowded, poor sanitation, no furniture, and learning materials arrive late to name a few. In extreme poverty cases, children walk kilometers daily and are forced to wade through rivers to get to school. These are just some of the factors that widen the inequality gap and result in poor educational outcomes at the end of the year of schooling. “South Africa has one of the most unequal school systems in the world. Children in the top 200 schools achieve more distinctions in mathematics than children in the next 6,600 schools combined. The playing field must be levelled,” said Sheila Mohamed, Executive Director of Amnesty International South Africa. Teachers leaving the country Apart from issues of infrastructure, sanitation, and safety, educators in South Africa are leaving the country in droves. For several years, South Africa has been seeing many skilled teachers leaving for greener pastures for the UAE and some Asian countries. A 2018 study found that the reason local educators were leaving for these countries was for financial, social, religious and the current political landscape in the country. The brain drain results from this low supply of experienced and highly skilled teachers in the system. Ultimately, schools are short staffed and classes experience overcrowding. Key factors that contribute to the quality of learning. While this study was from five years ago, the numbers are continuing to rise today. And few people are interested in joining the field. Where does that leave scholars, the education system, and the country as a whole? The looming gap in the education sector in South Africa A 2022 publication reported on a study by the Jake Gerwell Fellowship that within the next 10 years, nearly half (45%) of teachers will be retiring. South Africa’s retirement age is 60. Roughly half of the teachers are in their 50s. These numbers do not bode well for the education sector. Additionally, this crisis is further compounded by the number of educators leaving and the low uptake of people entering the field and choosing teaching as a career. Only 15 000 teachers are graduated annually. A figure below the 25 000 teaching graduates needed to maintain the supply-demand ratio. In fact, the study goes on to say that for about half of the current teachers, the field wasn’t their first or preferred career choice. Impact of skills shortage in education sector “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” —Nelson Mandela The impact on children, families, communities, cities and at a greater level, a country without teachers, TVET lecturers, and education support personnel is heavy. Without experienced and highly skilled teachers educating and imparting knowledge to learners, we could see the following impact: Compromises on qualifications and skills in hired teachers Reduced number of hired educators with the necessary subject specialism Inexperienced teachers Educators not a cultural fit Diminished scholar performance Poor classroom experience A drop in the quality of education and the professionals to provide this human right to children will leave a devastating impact on the future of the world. The solution No one solution exists to the looming crisis. Instead, there are several steps and actions that can be introduced and taken to and restrict the widening gap in the education sector. Some of these are: Raise standards of education Government must work to invest in vocational training Investment in digital infrastructure for digital learning that will aid and improve quality of learning Partner up with private sector to assist public school systems to bring in resources where they are lacking Allow private sector to innovate Upscale and upskill teachers Government must improve teacher training and reduce administrative tasks they are bogged down with Pay education personnel well to motivate them to stay in the country and not seek higher salaries outside the country Improve teacher status to encourage higher enrolment in teacher training degrees and courses, Invest in training programmes for secondary school leavers Create a supportive environment for personnel Improve infrastructure, salaries, education budget Improve access to quality education for all As it stands and if the gap continues to widen, this will hamper our economic growth and development plans. A poor education system and a broken sector will keep people in a vicious poverty cycle. All will, in the long run, have a positive impact on the country’s economy and perhaps begin to reduce the gap that’s growing in the education sector. If you’re interested in pursuing a career in education, the best and first place to start is with a personality assessment. This short and expertly designed personality assessment will guide you in better understanding your strengths and weaknesses. Upon completion, you’ll receive a list of recommended courses to get you skilled and ready for the workplace. If teaching runs through your blood and education field you want to get back into, update your resume with our free resume builder tool. Let’s all come together and see how we can stand in the gap, meet the need, and help build our country’s future leaders.","length":6247,"tokens":1172,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Looming Gap in the South African Education Sector","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/looming-gap-in-the-education-sector-in-sa","essay_date":"Jan 18, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"South Africa is a country alive with possibility.

You have a plan of what needs to be done. And if getting over the productivity hurdle was easy, you’d end the day or week with a clean slate and ready for the set of tasks. However, one of the areas we tend to struggle with is being productive and getting this done. If one of your new year goals is to be more productive and efficient at work, you’ve come to the right place.

Only that our to-do list doesn’t seem to be shrinking. We’re busy, but not productive. When we speak about productivity, we mean the measure of how efficiently an individual completes a task. It focuses on the output based on the inputs used and required to deliver that good or service. Being productive is a source of economic growth and vital to a company’s success. Why productivity is important Over and above the economic benefits to a company and a country’s GDP, there are several other reasons why productivity is important. A productive life helps you achieve and healthy work/life balance Resources are utilised efficiently and effectively Lower cost of production Higher profit margins Individuals are less stressed, much happier and fulfilled at work Greater focus Better use of time and freedom Allows to clarity on purpose, direction, values, and goals Businesses have a competitive edge in the market 10 tips to increase productivity There are various tips, tricks, practices, and methods to help you improve your productivity. We’ve listed a few below to get you started. Start and finish your day at the same time every day. Sticking to a routine and schedule helps keep things in focus. Set goals. These can be daily or weekly goals. Break down big tasks into smaller bit-sized tasks. When tasks seem more actionable, you will find them easier to get done. “The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small, manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.” – Mark Twain Learn to prioritise. Get high priority tasks done as soon as possible. Procrastination is a thief of time. Develop incentive programmes. Employers can introduce incentive programmes to motivate staff to complete tasks and ensure deadlines are met. Reduce screen time and distractions during work hours. All the hours spent scrolling your phone could be better spent ticking some things off your list. Try to avoid multitasking. This can leave your mind scattered and unfocused, resulting in tasks not being completed or taking longer to complete than necessary. Take regular breaks. You are not a robot. Regular breaks will keep your mind refreshed and your body energized to keep going throughout the day. Create a clear distinction between your home life and work life. Identify your peak productivity hours. Schedule your meetings for this period and use this time to put out your best work and get big tasks done. The Pomodoro technique for productivity The Pomodoro technique has long been lauded as the best tool to help you use your time wisely and be more productive. This technique works on the basis that your brain can focus for 25 minutes before “switching off”. How it works Set a timer for 25 minutes and work on a task until the timer rings. Take a 5-minute break to stretch, drink water, and “reset’. Reset the timer for another 25 minutes and work until the timer goes off again. Repeat the process four times. Set your next break to be 40-60 minutes long and then Get back to your 25 minutes and complete a task Alternatively, you can use Google task reminder tool to help you set tasks and reminders for when it’s time to complete the tasks. The key to productivity…find the method that works best for you. As we settle into 2023 and are expectant of what the year will bring, we can set ourselves up for a win. Take the time to create and define your personal and professional goals for the year. Write down what is needed to make them happen and prepare a plan to help you achieve these goals. If you identify time management as a hindrance to your productivity, sign up for a course and equip yourself with the free tools and resources you need to have your best year yet. When we do this, we’ll have a better outcome when it’s time to reflect on the year.","length":4618,"tokens":980,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"10 Tips to Increase Productivity","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/10-tips-to-increase-productivity","essay_date":"Jan 16, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"Every day or week starts the same.

Get high priority tasks done as soon as possible. Procrastination is a thief of time. Develop incentive programmes. Employers can introduce incentive programmes to motivate staff to complete tasks and ensure deadlines are met. Reduce screen time and distractions during work hours.

We all do. The difference between those who dream and those who live their dream is putting in the time, energy, and hard work to make those dreams come true. It’s been said that the richest place on earth is graveyards. There lie people with poems that were never written, songs that were left unsung, books that were never published – a field of dreams that never came true. The good news is you’re still on the right side of time and you can still achieve your dreams and be everything you want to be. The problem We know how it generally goes. The end of the year approaches and with it, goals, and resolutions for the coming year. We get excited about them. Write them and share them with everyone. The other side of this coin is the tendency we have to start strong in January but abandon the dream by February. This is because there isn’t often a plan or strategy on how you will achieve your dreams. Understanding your goals and achieving your dreams Have a “why”. It becomes easier to achieve your goals if they hold significant meaning and are connected to a purpose. “why” do you want this? The answer to your why will help you push past distractions and other things that don’t help you get where you want to go. Start small. “Rome wasn’t built in a day”. This age-old saying stands true today. The fact of the matter is anything you do will start with a first step. Whether you want to start coding, be fluent in another language, or get that diploma, there is a natural process and progression you will get through to get to the other side. Don’t despise small beginnings. Learn lessons along the way to help you succeed. Break down your goals. When we envision the dream, we tend to see it as one major goal. Which is what can be overwhelming when it’s time to start on them. The dream seems too big and impossible to achieve. But, if you break down the goal into smaller, bite-sized pieces and tasks, you will soon find that you are taking steps that bring you one step closer to the goal. Breaking them down into smaller goals is more manageable and will lower the risk of you stopping before you’ve made any headway. Demolish the obstacles. Truth time? You need to be honest with yourself and recognise the things that could get in the way of you achieving your dream. Is it self-doubt, procrastination, fears, lack of support, or something else? And once you’ve identified these, you can find a way to navigate them when they try and get in the way of you achieving your dreams. The biggest obstacle we must overcome in pursuit of our dreams is our minds, and how we think about things and ourselves. It’s been said that “Whether you believe you can do it, or you can’t, you’re probably right.” Learning about yourself, your strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes is a good way to start the journey to understanding your goals. Take our Workplace Personality Assessment and receive insights into who you are. Tips to achieving your dreams Be confident and have a positive attitude Keep your eyes on the prize Have fun along the way Be consistent Don’t be afraid to take on challenges and necessary risks in pursuit of your goals Drown out the voices of the naysayers Set up a good support system to push you Upskill yourself. Set a clear path and stick to it If you fail, fail forward And remember, be flexible. Not in your goals, but in how you achieve your goals. You may not learn a language by living in that country just yet. But by taking courses online, joining groups, reading, and practising the language every day, by the end of the year, you’ll be in a better position to assimilate into the country when you finally make that move. Alison has 50+ hubs that you can explore. Here, you can easily find all the related courses about a specific subject or topic and learn everything you need to know. SMART tricks to help you achieve your dreams There are a lot of reasons why you’ve struggled to make headway towards your dreams. Perhaps self-doubt, lack of guidance, motivation, lack of finances, or a host of other reasons. The ultimate tip and trick to not just achieving your goals but succeeding in them are in setting SMART goals. What are SMART goals? – Specific. Be specific about your goals. Don’t leave it at “I want to study further”. Example: I want to study coding to help me get that promotion at work. – Measurable. How will you measure the success of your goal? Is it one that can be measured and what metric will you use? Example: I will complete all assessments and check in with my course instructor on how I am doing and progressing. – Attainable. Be honest with yourself. Is the goal you are setting realistic? Nobody wants to be a dream killer but setting a goal to be a Grammy-winning artist when you can’t hold a note isn’t realistic and very unlikely unattainable. Example: on weekends I will take singing classes and hire a vocal coach to help improve my singing skills – Relevant. Is the goal or dream you have set aligned with who you are and your values? Example: I enjoy helping people and find fulfilment in it; therefore, taking courses in understanding mental help and being a caregiver will help me serve people better. – Time-bound. What time frame have you set to achieve your dream and goal? If you aim at nothing, you will hit it. So, you need to set down a timeline of when you hope to achieve the dream by being flexible to other elements you may not be able to control. Example: Within two years, I want to move to a team lead or supervisory role. These SMART goals give your dream direction and something you can revert to if you want to check how you are doing. Celebrate your wins, regardless of how small they seem. Things won’t always go as planned and that’s natural. But when you celebrate your wins, you release the happy hormone (dopamine) into your brain. This “feel good hormone” will push you to do more towards your goals and reinforce the behaviour that gets you there. If you can persevere through the challenges and overcome them, there’s nothing to stop you from achieving it.","length":6086,"tokens":1366,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Tips & Tricks to Achieve Your Dreams","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/tips-tricks-to-achieve-your-dreams","essay_date":"Jan 10, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"Anyone can dream.

Often, these goals are not often easy to achieve. The different demands that pull you in every direction. The unexpected obligations and commitments that come and require your full attention. It’s a daunting and overwhelming pursuit. Finding a 50/50 balance between work and home is not always simple and easy. Here, we explore ways to help you finding a work-life balance and get you as close as possible to achieving it. What is work-life balance? When we speak of work-life balance, we mean an equal distribution of time and energy between your career and family or personal life. This ideal is an even 50/50 share but this doesn’t look the same for everyone because of different factors affecting the scale. Furthermore, no two individuals have the same work and home life demands. There are kids, second income streams, partners, extramural activities, projects, deadlines, and life events that all come into the mix at different times. Balance, in effect, will never be 50/50 but the scale will tip to either side depending on what work and home looks like for everyone in a month, season, or year. Why is work-life balance important? Work and family life are two integral components to who we are. When you’re fulfilled at work you are more likely to be more productive, engaged, and happy. Outside of work, when you’re stress free, you’re able to give your time and attention to your loved ones as well as partake in necessary self-care. Both feed into each other and therefore investing in these elements that make us who we are, and our best selves is vital. Added to that, work life balance is important for various other reasons: A balanced life reduces stress levels and ultimately likelihood of the appearance of anxiety, burnout, depression, substance abuse Lowers chances of resignations brought about by undue stress and work pressure Improved quality of life Finding a balance between work and family life As mentioned earlier, we all prioritise different things. For the solely ambitious, giving their all to their career means longer work hours, less time with family and friends. For the family-focused, it means working less hours and directing time to home life instead of climbing the corporate ladder. For the individual wanting a bit of both, you have to make a few changes at work and at home to bring you to this equal ratio. Work Familiarise yourself with your company policies. Employers: What are your company policies regarding the health and wellness of your employees? What benefits are available to employees or can be introduced to help encourage work/life balance? If none are in place, look into introducing them. Things like access to therapy, financial coaching, health and fitness coaching are a good place to start. Employees: Make use of your employee benefits. Take your leave. Participate in engagement sessions, workshops, seminars, and other activities hosted by your employer that aim to facilitate a healthy workforce. Model work/life balance. Employers: Take leave and don’t send emails from the beach or your vacation house. Employees: Be firm when you’re available to respond to work calls and emails – work during work hours. Delegate tasks Employers: Learn how to delegate responsibilities and not pile everything on one individual. By giving others a share of the responsibilities, you encourage growth and their career development. This gives employees a sense of purpose and will want to stay longer in the company. Employees: You don’t need to be a superhero and “do it all”. Learn to say “no” and in some instances, when to ask your team to handle some of the tasks. This will help you be more productive and dedicate time to important tasks. Home Set a schedule. It can be difficult to keep up with everything going on and all the demands placed on you. Set a schedule weekly or monthly. This allows you to see what your commitments are, what is important or what you can decline and ensure your energy is directed to the right places and things. Switch off. We live our lives online. Streaming, music, emails, banking, and everything else is in the palm of your hand. This on demand nature we’ve become accustomed to makes it difficult to switch off. It can easily creep into family time and makes it difficult to draw the line between home and work. Put your phone away and be present with those around you. Exercise. No, this doesn’t mean you need to become a gym bunny by any means, but experts have stressed the importance 30 minutes of walking daily and the impact it has on our bodies, and minds. Exercise releases the happy hormone, endorphins, which contribute to making you feel good. It also helps relieve stress and regulate your mood. Find what works for you and stick to it. What’s important to remember about finding a balance between work and family life is that there is no cut-and-dry method for everyone. This is something that both employers and employees are responsible for. As an employer, you are a steady companion that doesn’t demand robotic output from your staff but instead, an encouragement of a healthy lifestyle. “Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work,” Aristotle. As an employee, you can’t pour from an empty cup. You are responsible for ensuring you have enough in your tank to give to yourself and your home life. If you find yourself struggling with your mental health resulting from stress and the pressures of life, take our free Wellbeing Assessment below. This will measure your mental health and wellbeing and suggest courses to take to help you learn how to live a healthier, happier, and more productive life. Wherever you find yourself on the balance scale, you can make changes that will bring you close to this perfect balance. In 2023, let’s strive for less productivity-driven output and more fulfilment, time and energy devoted to things that matter to you.","length":5959,"tokens":1240,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Finding a Work-Life Balance","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/finding-a-work-life-balance","essay_date":"Jan 4, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"It’s a new year and with it comes work aspirations and being more present at home.

How about your new year resolutions? Will they include mastering an instrument?

Apart from boosting your brainpower, the sheer pleasure to be had from being able to play music is reason enough to start. Keep reading to learn how to play an Irish instrument. The question is, where to begin? If you yearn to learn piano, but don’t have the space or the budget for the traditional upright, there are now many small electronic keyboards with prices to suit any budget. Perhaps you fancy scaling the heights with a wind instrument. A penny whistle is the perfect getaway instrument and is very affordable. It will train your ear and help you with the breathing techniques you need for playing the flute, sax or trombone. If strings are your thing, the guitar deserves its standing as the go-to instrument for flexibility and ease of learning. Or how about the violin? It’s harder to play but your perseverance will be rewarded. Once you have chosen your instrument, you’ll need lessons to help you master the basics and that’s where Alison comes in.

These courses will take you from basic beginner through to intermediate level in no time, teaching you skills that you can use across the genres. Music Instrument Courses Take our popular Guitar Beginner 1 course, for instance. Tutor Michael McCague provides lessons in the basics of playing using the Drop D tuning system, which lends chords a rich, open sound. His guitar classes will give you the foundations for playing blues and rock along with folk. Dermot Sheedy, drummer with top folk-rock band Hermitage Green, teaches the bodhrán courses and in the Intermediate course, progresses to extra rhythms and tips for adding colour to any drum rhythm. With the tin whistle and flute courses, champion player Brian O’Loughlin will show you how to breathe correctly and how to add ornamentation to make your playing more colourful. His brother, Conor O’Loughlin, will teach you all you need to know about playing the concertina or if you prefer a bigger box, another champion player, Conor Connolly, provides free button accordion classes.

It’s scary, unpleasant, and we don’t want to live in a state of panic or fear. But the truth is, knowing what to do and who to call in an emergency is a matter of life and death. Your calm and measured response can add life-saving minutes on a call to emergency responders. And when you’re at home, you want the security that your loved ones and belongings are safe and secure. This means having a smart home system that’s equipped with vital information to safeguard your home contents. To learn more about smart homes and emergency responses, we spoke to Alison Publisher, Gerard O’Driscoll. Please share with our learners a bit about your background. Over the past 30 years, I have served in a variety of management, ICT, and commercial positions in both the public and private sectors. In addition to my enthusiasm for the smart home space, I am an active investor in property and emerging Web 3.0 projects. You have a background as an ICT professional. What made you decide to create courses on Alison? Since the late nineties, I’ve been creating online courses that several thousand students from around the world have studied. Furthermore, I have authored a number of technology-focused books. The Alison course platform provides an ideal platform to share this content globally. For those just learning about you, please tell us more about EmergencyMentors and Smart Homes School: a) emergencymentors. com is a blog I created to help people correctly make an emergency call. b) smarthomesschool. com is my website which people visit to learn about setting up smart home devices to improve family safety and security levels. You’ve been a Self-publisher with Alison for several years. What do you enjoy most about publishing on this platform? The course creation tools, and technical support provided by Alison. com are excellent. Emergency Mentors Please share with us about your website emergencymentors. com and how that came to be. For a number of years, I managed the day-to-day operations of a 999/112 emergency call-taking organisation and decided to release a blog that provided people with relevant information related to this important industry sector. What should people know about emergencies? Emergencies do not happen very often, but when they do, you want to be ready. Know what to do ahead of time and try to stay in control. What’s the most common mistake people make in an emergency? When you find yourself in the middle of a 911 emergency, you might be on the verge of panic. No matter how dire the situation, you need to do your best to be calm and collected when making 911 calls. How does one plan for an emergency call? Before you pick up the phone to make a 911, 112, or 999 call to the emergency services, it’s best to be prepared. Some tips include: Post emergency numbers by your phone or in a highly visible place where everyone can refer to it Know the proper emergency number Know about any pre-existing medical conditions If I have any safety concerns, whom should I call? In the event of a 112 emergency, it is imperative to ensure that emergency services will arrive on the scene as quickly as possible. The number you dial will be geographically specific and it is important that you know this number. For instance, in the USA, 911 is the number you would use for safety concerns. Smart Home School What is a smart home? A smart home is a property that uses internet-connected devices to enable the remote control and automation of appliances and systems, such as lighting, heating, and security. This can make daily tasks more convenient and efficient and can enhance the overall security and safety of the home. Is it costly to turn your home into a smart home? The addition of a smart home system to your home is surprisingly affordable and relatively easy to install. There is a perception amongst the public that smart home automation systems are very expensive. Although this perception exists, the current reality is that the price point for introductory smart home kits in Europe is between €400 and €1,000, whereas in the USA price points are slightly lower. For instance, a $399 kit will provide you with a basic smartphone and smart speaker control of your lighting and heating system. If the smart home system is used proactively to manage electricity usage, then these types of systems often pay for themselves over a two- or three-year period. Why should people invest in smart homes? There is a perception out there that ‘fancy’ automation systems cost a fortune, whereas these systems are very affordable and can save you some money. Once installed and configured a next-generation smart home system helps you to save on your monthly electricity, gas, and water bills. Can smart home products reduce the risks of fire and flood damage? Smart Homes are synonymous with entertainment and increasing your security levels, but they can also make life safer at home. They can not only reduce risks to your or your family’s health but can also prevent costly damage to your house caused by fire and leaking water. How does smart home automation enhance your lifestyle? It is true to say that many smart home automation products released in the early years were buggy, technically complex, and required an IT-savvy person to run daily. The truth nowadays is that most, if not all smart home automation products provide easy control of all your lights, heating, security, and entertainment systems via a tablet, phone, smart speaker, or PC. What are the benefits of having a smart home? Although the benefits of adding smart automation to your home will vary from person to person, there are some general ones that most people can enjoy as a result of adding smart home systems to a property. My three favorites are: Smart home devices are simple to use. A properly implemented smart home can improve your comfort and convenience. Enhanced security and safety levels. One misconception about smart homes is that they are only for the wealthy or those with big houses. How true is this? It is embellished in most people’s minds that smart house automation is not affordable and only available to ‘rich’ people in our society. The truth is that major service providers are reselling affordable smart house control and alarm subscription products to their existing base of customers. So smart home automation is in fact becoming a mainstream solution and no longer is home automation confined to the privileged in society! More about Gerard’s courses Who should take your courses? My courses are structured to fit a wide variety of students.

Many people don’t realize the impact that smart home devices can have on their daily lives. ‘Home Automation: How to Make a Smart Home’ provides a roadmap to change your life for the better.

If you haven’t, it’s a term that was coined in 2021 and spurred by the global pandemic. Under this great resignation, companies and organisations saw many of their staff resign from their jobs. There are many factors that influenced this great move and continue to be of concern to employers. The tide is still turning on this great move. If you weren’t part of the crowd that resigned but have considered it, why not take this time as we reflect on the year gone by and to rethink your career. The shift Am I in the right job? Is my job fulfilling? Is it time to priortise other aspects of my life? Pertinent questions that you should ask and prompted the big shift in people’s employees during the peak of the pandemic. And these are some of the questions that prompted many employees to rethink their careers amid the great resignation. People are looking for more flexible working environments, they want to achieve better work-life balance and have job satisfaction and fulfillment to some degree. Great questions to ask yourself every-so-often in your professional career. But what does this mean for you and me? The great rethink The great rethink triggers you to ponder whether you fit in with your company’s culture. Are you comfortable with your career growth and advancement opportunities in the company? Are you treated fairly? Are their policies in line with your values? If nothing changed in the company in the next year, two years or even five, would you still be happy? If you’ve spent time on these questions and the answers aren’t indicative of a positive shift towards your goals and values, you are in the right space to think about what you want, value, and pin down what your life and career goals are. And then you need to begin searching for companies that “tick all the boxes.” You are allowed to rethink your career options. You can make a change. But the transition and the next steps are hard. We’ve put together some helpful tips to help you along your way. The next steps The first thing to think about is what you do. Before deciding on a career shift that could leave you in the same situation in 18 months, you need to ask critical questions. You also need to come up with a career strategy that will get you the results you want. This will take time and work. And it definitely won’t happen overnight. Make work more enjoyable Your thinking reveals that you do need a change. Before making the leap to another company, talk to your manager and find out if you can explore a different work and office set up. You may find that a hybrid working solution, more (or less) responsibilities, and flexible hours are all you need to make work more enjoyable. Take a break When last did you take a break and go on holiday? Without your laptop or answering work emails by the pool? A step away and break could be all you mind needs to recharge and feel rejuvenated about your job again.

Your Alison profile is a great tool that you can share on social platforms and with employers that tell people who you are. Your profile can serve as your personal brand.

You’re not alone. According to a recent report by Glassdoor, digital marketing jobs are some of the most sought-after by both Gen Z and other generations. But what if you don’t have a degree in marketing? Does that mean some of the top marketing jobs are out of reach? Not at all. While having a marketing degree is going to help you get a foot in the door with recruiters, it’s not the only way to impress a company enough to want to hire you. Within this article, we’re going to walk through how you can get a job in digital marketing without having a degree. What skills are most desirable? If you’re hoping to break into marketing, the first step is to make sure it’ll be the right fit for you. Most digital marketers have at least some of the following skills. Analytical – Digital marketing is all about crunching the numbers and finding ways to improve conversion rates. The goal for any marketing team is to deliver leads and revenue at the lowest possible cost. Strategic Thinking – Marketers need to have the ability to think outside the box. This means being able to come up with new, creative ideas that can help drive new customer growth. Understanding Social Media – Social media marketing is one of the most desirable jobs in marketing. You get paid to be on Instagram and TikTok all day. Understanding how each platform works and its best practices is crucial. Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) – Being able to drive organic traffic is a cost- efficient way for businesses to increase traffic and leads. Understanding basic and complex SEO strategies is a great skill to have. Paid Media – SEO takes time, but paid media through pay-per-click (PPC) advertising can help deliver traffic instantly. The goal is to understand how to efficiently set up a campaign that maximises the company’s budget. How to Get a Marketing Job Without a Degree If you want to get into marketing but don’t have a degree, there are several things you can do to wow potential employers. Here are a few strategies that will help you land your dream job. Submerse yourself in information If you haven’t taken any formal marketing classes, one of the best things you can do is read as much information as possible on the topics you enjoy. Should you be passionate about social media marketing, websites like Social Media Examiner have a huge amount of information covering all kinds of social media marketing topics. Additionally, if you’re interested in SEO, you can look at websites like Search Engine Land. You can explore some popular tools like Semrush. This platform has a lot of great basic and advanced topics on search engine optimisation. Take a course or get a certificate If you want to get a deeper understanding of certain areas of digital marketing, consider taking a course or earning a certificate. There are a number of digital marketing courses on Alison. com that cover things like social media marketing, email marketing, affiliate marketing, and more. In addition to taking a course, you can earn certificates through Hubspot Academy. Different tracks include things like Inbound marketing, content marketing, general digital marketing, and more. What’s great about Hubspot Academy is that when you complete a certification track, you’ll earn a badge that can be added to your LinkedIn profile. Gain hands-on experience What’s better than getting real-world, hands-on experience? To do this you could start your own blog or social media channels. If you choose to start your own blog, you can play around with content to learn more about SEO and how to effectively drive traffic with proper on-page SEO and off-page SEO strategies. Volunteering your time for someone you know could also be a great way to gain valuable experience. “I’ve found that learning new skills through volunteering is one of the best ways to advance your skill set,” said Teresa Pennington, Senior Strategic Partnership Manager at TurboTenant. “I wanted to learn how to build a website, so I offered to redo the website of a local non-profit. This motivated me to dive in and learn platforms like Wix, and also have a finished, impactful result to show off,” Pennington said. You could also consider looking for an internship that would allow you to get your feet wet with an established company. It’s not uncommon for internships to lead to full-time jobs. Start networking Networking is one of the best ways to get your foot in the door with a company. Search LinkedIn for marketing professionals in your area and invite them to coffee. This is a great opportunity to tell them more about you and pick their brain for any advice they might have. Making these connections can help you build your skills but can also assist you to get an edge when it comes to finding a job. There are also a lot of great LinkedIn groups focused on marketing. By joining these groups, you can interact with other professionals and build relationships. Final thoughts If you don’t have a degree, the next best thing is a desire to be successful. If you can show a potential employer that you not only have the knowledge to do the job but also the motivation to succeed and grow each day, finding a great marketing job is possible.","length":5277,"tokens":1101,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"How to Get a Job in Digital Marketing Without a Degree","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/how-to-get-a-job-in-digital-marketing-without-a-degree","essay_date":"Dec 16, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Have you ever thought about what it would be like to work in digital marketing?

There are many ways to achieve your goals and many platforms at your disposal. The key is knowing and understanding how best to utilise these platforms to your advantage and bolster your success. A rich platform for affiliates to use is Reddit. If this is new to you as an affiliate, or you need to know how to win on Reddit, then this article is for you. Let’s learn more about how to use reddit for marketing. What is Reddit? Reddit is one of the largest, or smallest (depending on how you look at things) social media platforms today. Reddit is a forum-based social media site that was founded in 2005 by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman. Unlike Facebook, Reddit was created to be a bulletin board for people with different interests. How does Reddit work? Within the site are thousands of smaller communities, called a “subreddit”, each covering a specific niche in the market. Each of these communities are represented by ‘r/tag’, for example, r/birdwatchers. From bird watchers to shoe fanatics and everything in between, you’ll undoubtedly find it on Reddit. In these communities, you can post interesting questions or have hearty discussions that other “redditors” can comment on and engage with. Each subreddit has its own rules, discussions, moderators (the community gatekeepers), and “ways of working”. At first glance it may seem strange for an affiliate to use this platform, but what sets Reddit apart from other sites is its uniqueness. That is, if you can successfully find your niche market and break into it, you can find a gold mine of potential revenue and thrive as an affiliate. Affiliate marketing on Reddit What every affiliate knows is that you need traffic, that is, people visiting the website or specific product that you are promoting. If more people set eyes on your content, that means you have more opportunities to make commission. 2021 statistics indicated that Reddit had over 1.7 billion, yes, billion, visits in June of that year. That’s traffic and bank for any affiliate marketer. It is also important for affiliates to be aware that Reddit has an official policy on affiliate marketing. They have an anti-spam policy that protects its communities against spam posts that could tarnish the purity of their communities and discussions. They are so strict on this that you could be banned from subreddits if you violate their policy. In cases where affiliates ignore these requests from redditors, you can even be banned from the site entirely. Can you use Reddit as an affiliate? The above might make you pause and wonder if affiliate marketing on Reddit is worth it. The rules seem strict and nearly impossible to get passed. But it is possible. Success as an affiliate takes time, effort, research, and a lot of work. Where you can simply share a link in a post on other platforms, on Reddit, you need to put in the time to engage with the communities and use traditional affiliate techniques to get results. You have to find your audience, nurture your audience, and then sell to them. It’s affiliate marketing for the long haul. How to use Reddit as a marketing tool So, how do you navigate this platform and thrive as an affiliate on Reddit? You need a strategy. Build a niche community. Reddit is all about community. For affiliates, this is great news because with your subreddit you will have a ready-to-buy audience at your fingertips. Moreover, you become an authority on what you post about. This helps you build trust with your community and will make them more responsive to what you promote. Become an expert. If building your own subreddit from scratch is not for you (it is a fulltime job) then work on becoming an expert in an already existing subreddit. You do this by providing valuable, credible, and legitimate insights, comments, tips, asking and answering questions posted in that community. Once you’re established (it will take time), you can ask the community moderator for permission to share your affiliate product with the rest of the community. Go viral through organic traffic. This is easier said than done because no one can accurately determine what post will go viral or not. The first step to this is through the above – becoming an expert. Once you’ve reached a credible status you can share a post rich in value that will capture audiences and have them wanting more from you. But make it natural and don’t try and trick the community into something that isn’t true as you will get caught and banned. Affiliate marketing is a business after all, and trust and credibility is the foundation to any successful business. Get an ad Sometimes you must spend money to make money and that’s where paid advertising comes in. Like anywhere else, people often tend to ignore or skip ads that don’t grab their attention. Therefore, you need to ensure your ad is posted in the right niche market, is gripping and looks like a post. Try to make your copy look like other posts shared on Reddit, people will pay more attention to it this way. However, what will distinguish it as an ad is the “sponsored” next to it. Top tips for affiliate marketing on Reddit. Like marketing on any other platform, you have to know your audience. Use titles. These will make your post stand out. Use tags in your brackets like this [Discussion], [Image]. Find smaller subreddits to post in. This will give you more exposure. Be sure to follow the rules and guidelines of each subreddit. Provide credible sources for anything you post. Research what other affiliates are doing successfully on Reddit and replicate it – but make it yours. Be helpful. As much as you want commission, don’t make all you post be about you. Offer good advice, comment, and engage with others. Some helpful subreddits you can join are: https://www. reddit. com/r/Affiliate/ https://www. reddit. com/r/DigitalMarketing/ Affiliate marketing is a lot of work. In some instances, it’s trial and error, especially when you’re using a new platform while also trying to remain relevant and provide your audience with fresh content. But all things are possible, even on harder to reach platforms like Reddit. Affiliate marketers on Reddit have a community where they discuss this trade and how to make the most of the platform. Your affiliate sub-reddit can be found here. Find help. Be helpful. And win at affiliate marketing on Reddit.","length":6464,"tokens":1354,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"How to use Reddit for Marketing","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/how-to-use-reddit-for-marketing","essay_date":"Dec 15, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"As an affiliate, you are always on the lookout for new channels and fresh ideas to grow and become successful.

Let’s learn more about how to use reddit for marketing. What is Reddit? Reddit is one of the largest, or smallest (depending on how you look at things) social media platforms today. Reddit is a forum-based social media site that was founded in 2005 by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman. Unlike Facebook, Reddit was created to be a bulletin board for people with different interests.","content_length":848,"content_tokens":177,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"How to use Reddit for Marketing","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/how-to-use-reddit-for-marketing","essay_date":"Dec 15, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"How does Reddit work? Within the site are thousands of smaller communities, called a “subreddit”, each covering a specific niche in the market. Each of these communities are represented by ‘r/tag’, for example, r/birdwatchers. From bird watchers to shoe fanatics and everything in between, you’ll undoubtedly find it on Reddit. In these communities, you can post interesting questions or have hearty discussions that other “redditors” can comment on and engage with. Each subreddit has its own rules, discussions, moderators (the community gatekeepers), and “ways of working” At first glance it may seem strange for an affiliate to use this platform, but what sets Reddit apart from other sites is its uniqueness. That is, if you can successfully find your niche market and break into it, you can find a gold mine of potential revenue and thrive as an affiliate.","content_length":862,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"How to use Reddit for Marketing","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/how-to-use-reddit-for-marketing","essay_date":"Dec 15, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Affiliate marketing on Reddit What every affiliate knows is that you need traffic, that is, people visiting the website or specific product that you are promoting. If more people set eyes on your content, that means you have more opportunities to make commission. 2021 statistics indicated that Reddit had over 1.7 billion, yes, billion, visits in June of that year. That’s traffic and bank for any affiliate marketer. It is also important for affiliates to be aware that Reddit has an official policy on affiliate marketing. They have an anti-spam policy that protects its communities against spam posts that could tarnish the purity of their communities and discussions. They are so strict on this that you could be banned from subreddits if you violate their policy. In cases where affiliates ignore these requests from redditors, you can even be banned from the site entirely. Can you use Reddit as an affiliate? The above might make you pause and wonder if affiliate marketing on Reddit is worth it.","content_length":1004,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"How to use Reddit for Marketing","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/how-to-use-reddit-for-marketing","essay_date":"Dec 15, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"The rules seem strict and nearly impossible to get passed. But it is possible. Success as an affiliate takes time, effort, research, and a lot of work. Where you can simply share a link in a post on other platforms, on Reddit, you need to put in the time to engage with the communities and use traditional affiliate techniques to get results. You have to find your audience, nurture your audience, and then sell to them. It’s affiliate marketing for the long haul. How to use Reddit as a marketing tool So, how do you navigate this platform and thrive as an affiliate on Reddit? You need a strategy. Build a niche community. Reddit is all about community. For affiliates, this is great news because with your subreddit you will have a ready-to-buy audience at your fingertips. Moreover, you become an authority on what you post about. This helps you build trust with your community and will make them more responsive to what you promote. Become an expert.","content_length":955,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"How to use Reddit for Marketing","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/how-to-use-reddit-for-marketing","essay_date":"Dec 15, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"If building your own subreddit from scratch is not for you (it is a fulltime job) then work on becoming an expert in an already existing subreddit. You do this by providing valuable, credible, and legitimate insights, comments, tips, asking and answering questions posted in that community. Once you’re established (it will take time), you can ask the community moderator for permission to share your affiliate product with the rest of the community. Go viral through organic traffic. This is easier said than done because no one can accurately determine what post will go viral or not. The first step to this is through the above – becoming an expert. Once you’ve reached a credible status you can share a post rich in value that will capture audiences and have them wanting more from you. But make it natural and don’t try and trick the community into something that isn’t true as you will get caught and banned.","content_length":914,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"How to use Reddit for Marketing","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/how-to-use-reddit-for-marketing","essay_date":"Dec 15, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Affiliate marketing is a business after all, and trust and credibility is the foundation to any successful business. Get an ad Sometimes you must spend money to make money and that’s where paid advertising comes in. Like anywhere else, people often tend to ignore or skip ads that don’t grab their attention. Therefore, you need to ensure your ad is posted in the right niche market, is gripping and looks like a post. Try to make your copy look like other posts shared on Reddit, people will pay more attention to it this way. However, what will distinguish it as an ad is the “sponsored” next to it. Top tips for affiliate marketing on Reddit. Like marketing on any other platform, you have to know your audience. Use titles. These will make your post stand out.

When it comes to learning, what works for you may not necessarily for me. We all learn differently. You need to discover your learning style and what method works best for you to not just make the grade to progress, but to enjoy the learning process. Keep reading to find out more about learning styles. Learning Styles How we learn has been a keen area of interest for many theorists. When we speak about “learning styles”, we mean an individual mixture of styles. We have different strengths and preferences. And for most of us, we have a combination of learning styles. There is no one correct way to learn and these approaches to learning are not fixed. You may read this and recognise slipping between these at various times over the course of a programme. Why do learning styles matter? A professional looking to upskill their resume. A college going individual with a desire to enhance their studies with additional courses. Or you have a young child in school. It doesn’t matter what you’re studying, the difference in how we learn affects how we absorb and retain the information. Another factor that affects learning but is often ignored is your personality type. This is often referred to as ‘interactive learning’. Here, those with extroverted personalities learn better in a group setting. They thrive off working with others, bouncing off ideas and engaging in discussions as part of the learning. An intrapersonal learning style, for the introverts on the other hand, learn better alone. These learners absorb information better at their own pace. This learning style is often accompanied by other learning styles. VAK Learning Styles The Visual-Auditory-Kinesthetic (VAK) learning styles are a simple means to explain and understand the different kinds of learning styles. This is a favourite learning theory style because its principles and benefits extend to all learning and development types. People are believed to also have a more dominant learning style, although in most cases, there is a mix or balance of the three featured styles. This learning style model is also referred to as VARK (Visual-Auditory-Reading-Kinesthetic) or VACT (Visual-Auditory-Kinesthetic-Tactile). Let’s learn more about these different styles. Visual “Visual learners” are those individuals who learn better through watching videos and taking online courses. As a visual learner, you are most likely attached to colours and rich visual aids. You will get the most out of your earning through delivery that utilizes visual aids, diagrams, graphs, and PowerPoint presentations to name a few examples. These visuals aid the learning process by making you understand the material, structures, and ideas presented better. Tip: Colour code your notes to help you organize the learning material. Auditory No one remembers song lyrics quite like you. As an auditory style learner, you learn better by hearing and listening and store information by how it sounds. The more you hear something, the more likely you are to remember it. Using audio books is one such example you can use to learn. For individuals who lean towards aural learning, it’s important to understand that they pay better attention to what is being said, rather than what is on a screen or a board. Tip: Read your written notes aloud to yourself to help process the information. Kinesthetic Some individuals learn better by “doing” something, that is, using hands to learn and develop a skill. You talk with your hands, gesture a lot and are more likely to open the back of something to figure out how it works. The kinesthetic (or tactile) learners grasp content better when they’re actively performing a task. So, whether they are reciting information or pacing around a room while learning, the information is received better when active as opposed to written instructions. Tip: review your study material while on the move, even while exercising. Take regular breaks during your study time and come back refreshed. Added to this list are the reading/writing learners who learn best by reading and writing the material down. How to identify your learning style Now that we’ve covered the different learning styles, you need to identify your personal style. Here are a few ways to do this. For visual learners, use a visual memory test where you try to recall as many images as possible. If this test was relatively easy, you may be a visual learner. To test if you are an auditory learner, listen to an audio recording from your class or lesson and test yourself to see how many facts you can list out. For the reading/writing learners, if you read a lot and take pages of notes in a class, you may be this type of learner. Like the auditory test, read a chapter of a book and then try remembering as many of the key ideas after a break. Kinesthetic learners. Ask yourself two essential questions. Do you get the best results from learning when you do something? How well do you do in motor-related skill activities? If these responses are positive, then you are likely a kinesthetic learner. Your learning style is best identified by the mode of study that gives you the best learning outcome. When you understand your learning style, you will have a better learning experience. The key thing to remember is that whatever journey you are on, learning is an essential part of the growth process. What differs is how each of us acquires the learning received and finding the motivation to succeed. And when you find your learning style, you’ll prime yourself for success and have a more balanced and effective learning process.","length":5620,"tokens":1142,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Discovering Your Learning Style","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/discovering-your-learning-style","essay_date":"Dec 9, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Here’s what we know for sure.

Personal boundaries help you maintain a level of control of your work life, your relationships, and what you give your time to. Boundaries you set for yourself help direct your energy on what matters most, what you can and should prioritise, what you’re able to do and help you avoid burnout. In this article, we give you guidelines on how to set boundaries at work and give you essential tips to ensure people adhere to them. What are boundaries? A boundary is a limit that you set up to help people understand how to navigate various situations and interactions with you. These boundaries can be tangible (physical) or intangible (emotional and mental). Physical boundaries Physical boundaries refer to your personal space and have to do with your body, and what you are comfortable with. An example of this is choosing to work in a conference room (away from people) if you want to focus on a particular task. This can also take the form of saying “no” to a late night out because you know how your body responds to a lack of sleep. And finally, this can also look like scheduling breaks in your workday to get fresh air, regroup, and come back fresh and energised to continue at work. Emotional boundaries Emotional boundaries speak to how you prioritise your feelings, thoughts, and ideas and have them respected. They also mean not feeling forced to adopt other people’s thoughts, opinions and struggles or challenges that you don’t have the capacity to take on or are comfortable with. In the workplace, this can look like choosing not to discuss your personal life (or certain aspects of it) with colleagues, and not taking responsibility for other people’s feelings. You are only responsible for your actions. Stand up for yourself, defend your choices or say something if you are unjustly criticised. Why are boundaries important at work? To do the best at work, you need to be in the right mental space – which means setting healthy boundaries. There is only so much any one person can do and sometimes, your boundary will look like saying “no” to one thing so that you can say “yes” to another. Boundaries at work help define the roles and responsibilities each person has. They also help you avoid burnout, feeling resentful, and unsatisfied in your job, and often have a negative impact on your mental health. But boundaries help form strong and healthy relationships. And a happy employee who feels safe and respected at work is bound to want to do more. Tips for setting boundaries at work It’s one thing to know your boundaries. If your colleagues don’t know your boundaries, they will without malice or bad intention infringe on them because you didn’t communicate these ahead of time. Prioritise your values The most important thing you need to establish is what is important to you. Ask yourself what your boundaries are to ensure you are happy and productive at work. You need to know what is important to you. If family and personal time are important to you, set time aside for when you deal with work-related issues like replying to emails or taking calls outside of work hours. This helps you separate your work and personal life Communicate your boundaries Once you have set your boundaries up, communicate these with your team, manager, and other co-workers. This lets them know in advance what is acceptable and not acceptable to you. Have clear and honest conversations about these. And if you feel they are disrespecting your boundaries, be proactive. Have the often-difficult conversations explaining that they stepped on your boundaries, how that made you feel, and the impact of their actions. Don’t wait for issues to pile up for months and then let them all out at once. Speak about it as soon as it happens and remind them of your boundaries Create structures to support your boundaries and keep them in place It can be difficult for people to understand your perspective on things. You are obligated to perform certain tasks at work. On other occasions, you may be asked to do more than what your role is. Explain your workloads, high priority tasks and explain that doing a new task will mean another will fall down the task list as you can’t do both. Clear boundary structures will allow for fewer infractions on your boundaries so your boundaries need to be strong, and you will need to ensure they are solid. Have a game plan on how to respond to those instances when someone will cross your boundaries. Delegate Many people fear that if they begin setting boundaries for themselves, people will see them as not being team players, being rude, selfish, and not doing their job. You worry about the potential repercussions of saying “no” to certain tasks and requests. But, if something is outside your scope of expertise, this is when you need to say “no” and delegate that task to someone who is more adept at the work. Practice saying “no” “No” is a full sentence and doesn’t need an explanation. Decide who needs an explanation. It’s tough and you may worry about how you will be perceived, but if you say “yes” when you want to say “no”, people will keep asking. It will take time and practice but remain firm in your stance and make sure those lines do not become blurred. Take time off We are not robots that can work and work without breaking down. Even robots need regular maintenance to function. Likewise, take leave and time off when you need it. You’re entitled to take leave and have earned it. Make time for self-care. Take time off. Enjoy it. And set that out-of-office message and enjoy time away from work. Trust us, the building will still be standing when you come back. Remember, boundaries are important and there isn’t anything unusual about having them and doing what you need to do to ensure they aren’t stepped on.","length":5920,"tokens":1257,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Setting Boundaries at Work","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/setting-boundaries-at-work","essay_date":"Dec 8, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"In the same way that guardrails and barriers protect us when we’re driving on the road, we need personal boundaries to keep ourselves safe.

From childhood and right through to adulthood, our lives are shaped by our thoughts. Our Alison Publisher Spotlight shines on founder of PsyNOMAD, İlbey UÇAR. He spoke to us about the value of psychology across different fields and how he’s designed his courses to ensure that these services are available to all, regardless of their economic level. Publishing on Alison Please share with our learners a bit about your background. I grew up in Turkey. Since childhood, I have had a serious inclination to understand people and solve people’s problems. That’s why psychology has always been my main area of ​​interest. I completed my psychology undergraduate and psychology graduate education in Turkey. Currently, I am doing my PhD on Sports Psychology in Movement and Training Sciences at Istanbul Gelişim University, one of the most prestigious universities in Istanbul. I’ve always wanted to work as a psychologist in the private sector instead of being a civil servant. This is because I like the routine and non-innovative lifestyle. I chose to work in the private sector in order to improve myself and be beneficial to humanity, and I worked this way until the start of the 2019 pandemic. My professional interests have developed on psycho-social development of disadvantaged groups, supporting discriminated groups with education, disabled people, and special education areas. You founded PsyNOMAD. Please tell us more about your company. I decided to start my own business while working in the private sector during the pandemic. Providing psychological education in Turkey involves a costly and difficult process. You may need the support of public and private institutions, and even the support of politicians and politicians when appropriate. The best way to do this was to provide services for people who could access my training online. By establishing my company, I aimed to share my professionalism in the online education sector with other people in need. I started to serve on many online platforms and my training was valued and encouraged by Alison. This made me very happy because it was very important that the Alison was aligned with my motto; “democracy in education, free access to education for all”. I currently have a team of about 13 people, with the support of Alison, and we are passionate about making better training day by day. PsyNOMAD is currently located in Turkey, but we are planning to establish a new company in Ireland in the next 3 years. You’ve published on Alison for several years. What made you decide on publishing on this platform? I was planning to produce useful training for many people by reaching more people at an affordable price in the online education sector. One day I was contacted by the Alison and offered an opportunity to partner with them and publish on the platform. Alison was officially the partner of my dreams. They were targeting individuals who really need education with free training. I immediately accepted the offer and we have been working together for about 2-3 years. What lessons or takeaways have you learned as a self-publisher on Alison? I learned a lot of lessons from Alison like E-Learning theory courses, software courses, child development and psychology courses. I even signed up for a few courses I was curious about. I think the most important feature of Alison courses is that they do not force people into certain professions. The online education sector has recently started to provide the same person the chance to receive training in more than one profession. Alison offers this in the best and free way. I also use Alison courses to train my employees for free and I am very satisfied What words of advice would you give someone who would like to become a publisher on Alison? First, they have to be patient, disciplined, and unconditionally trust Alison. Alison offers the best support and facilities for both students and publishers. If the company thinks that a business needs to be developed, I think it’s important for publishers to be compatible. It is their work as a true business partner to show responsibility towards Alison and to carry out their business professionally. In addition, it will be to their advantage to be transparent in everything they do. Moreover, sharing their plans for broadcasting processes with the company frequently will prevent them from overcoming problems that they cannot foresee. Psychology and Cognitive Therapy You have a psychology background. Can you share with us why understanding psychology is important? As humans, we are social beings and social interaction is a very important lifelong process for us. We need the science of psychology to understand this process and react properly. Psychology has important purposes such as understanding, controlling and predicting human behavior. That’s why we need psychology not only as professionals, but as human beings. You have several courses on cognitive therapy. Please explain what it is, who should use it and what its benefits are. The purpose of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is to enable the person to analyze and recognize the behavioral process, and to make his thoughts and reactions to different situations more useful to himself. It is applied to individuals with psychological disorders such as anxiety disorders, panic attacks, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, obesity, and PTSD. What are some misconceptions about psychology and therapy? “No matter what you go for, every therapy is the same!” Yes, the first one or two sessions can be similar because here the person tries to share and resolve their concerns about privacy and trust. Apart from that, therapy is completely dependent on the therapist. The differences in terms of age, awareness and development of the person who will receive the therapy will change the direction of the therapy. “How is sitting and talking going to solve my problems!” Simply put, yes, talking doesn’t solve problems. On the other hand, psychotherapy is not just talking. Therapists are trained in the art of language and will engage in purposeful conversations about your concerns with your goals in mind. If you are in therapy and it seems to you that you are just talking, it means that you did not see that the therapist is trying to solve the root of your problems in this cleverly constructed conversation, that he is actually brainstorming with you for a solution. “I have enough peers in my social life. They support me, I do not benefit from therapy!” Support from the social environment certainly has a huge impact on incoming mental health. Even therapists strive to establish a social support mechanism in therapy. However, therapy does not end when we make these connections. Your loved ones are not trained professionals. Psychotherapists are trained in the art of listening, problem-solving, and taking a non-judgmental, neutral stance. “Crazy people go to therapy!” This is the most disturbing yet common misconception about therapy. This image of therapy is rather distorted: just because we care about our health and need therapy doesn’t mean we’re crazy. On the contrary, it means that we accept that there is a problem and that we are brave enough to ask for help. This discriminatory approach may cause real symptoms to go unnoticed and worsen the situation. “All therapists do is do this, do this, do that!” A good therapist will often avoid giving advice because what they really want to do is strengthen your free decision-making. A skilled therapist will try to help you make decisions on your own so that you use your own ideas, not his, to manage your problems. It empowers you with your decisions, so you don’t feel lonely and exhausted in difficult decisions. “Always take medicine!” Specialties vary when it comes to mental health. If you are considering a medicated recovery, the person you need will be a psychiatrist. Speech therapy can be provided by psychologists, counselors, or social workers. In most cases, talk therapy is the first suggestion for recovery. The need for medication will be a decision you and your therapist will make, given the severity and urgency of the situation, and your situation. No one will force you to take medicine or try to convince you that once you take medicine everything will be okay. How have your courses empowered your students? My courses support students with videos and articles that combine theoretical and practical information. While creating the contents of this course, I have prepared the most important research and effective studies in the world. In general, my courses aim to cover different topics and subject diversity. It shows that in addition to popular topics, I also target topics that people really need but that are out of sight. I aim to launch the courses in parallel with the free, effective and useful training process, which is one of the goals of Alison company. I get feedback on many platforms that my courses are really helpful, and that makes me really happy. What are some key takeaways students will gain from taking your courses? To have a detailed and general knowledge of early childhood development. Understanding and benefiting from how deep the science of psychology is. Understanding the importance of being a good mother and a good father from a child’s early years to adulthood. Expanding professional knowledge for field workers. Why should people be invested in continuing/furthering their studies? People generally see the education they have received in their university life as sufficient. However, this alone is never enough. It’s about investing in their own knowledge and professional knowledge. The ability to analyze gives complex thinking skills by considering various factors. The main facts that will distinguish them from other people are the development of their analytical and thinking skills. And they must do this as a lifetime improvement, not just for a few years of their life. Can someone who isn’t pursuing a career in psychology take your courses? Of course anyone can take my courses. My courses aim to develop the knowledge and skills of everyone. My courses are aimed not only at those who aim to develop themselves professionally, but also everyone who is interested in psychology and early childhood or who aims to solve the problems they experience. Is there a difference in approach or therapy techniques between child psychology and adult psychology? Children’s ways of expressing their feelings and thoughts are much more unique. While some children can express themselves verbally well, others may not be able to express themselves verbally well. For example; while we can analyze a child with insufficient verbal skills or who prefers to express their feelings more artistically with the “draw a picture” test, it may seem pointless to apply this to an adult. Is there a difference between child psychology and adult psychology in terms of approach or therapy techniques? As adults complete a significant part of their psychological, social and biological developmental period, they may be more skilled in expressing themselves and participating in the therapy process. For this reason, there are important differences between child psychology and adult psychology in terms of therapy techniques or therapy approaches, and this difference should exist. How does psychology affect us personally and professionally? Psychologically important when we engage in social interaction. How we host other people, how we behave, and which one we display is formed by the influence of psychological science. Psychology helps you understand relationships Psychology education doesn’t necessarily make you healthier, but psychology education does offer you more knowledge and understanding of personal, family, and professional relationships. This means that studying psychology will definitely allow you to solve any relationship problems that you or anyone in your information circle may have. Psychology helps develop critical thinking skills. Psychology, with the help of the methods taught during this residency, focuses heavily on how to think critically. Critical thinking is one of the most important methods of thinking. This type of thinking helps in all areas of life, especially in the areas of education, and this type of thinking greatly helps you develop yourself and show your best talents and abilities. Psychology offers more employment opportunities. Contrary to popular belief that psychology doesn’t offer you many job opportunities, psychology graduates actually have great job opportunities and more! If you are studying psychology, you will be required to work in many fields such as law, social work, education, business and many other professions. Psychology is one of the most influential fields in the workplace. Organizational industrial psychology focuses on understanding the human nature of those working in the workplace. Knowledge of human behavior is the most important focus when it comes to presenting a work. Your knowledge of the basics of psychology makes you a more important employee/manager in the business world. How does one know if they, or their child, needs to consult in therapy? Every person can experience mental and emotional problems at some point in his life. It may be difficult to make connections between events, or the person may not be able to make a sound decision in his attempt to choose the right option for himself. It is inevitable in our daily lives to have fluctuating moods and fluctuations in our changing moods in interaction with our environment. However, in some cases, there are situations that the person cannot resolve on their own and needs support. At this point, you can get therapy services from psychologists or psychotherapists. Some of the events we experience in our lives can affect us deeply, sometimes we experience this situation with intense emotions and sometimes we forget it without realizing it, but our unconscious continues to record the events. Many situations that we think we are not affected spiritually can sometimes lead to traumatic results. As time passes, our body responds to us with the accumulations we experience spiritually. The process begins with the individual’s awareness of himself or being guided by his environment, becoming aware of his problems, and the desire to solve the troubled situation that he cannot get out of. PsyNOMAD What feedback have you received from learners about your course? Students always find my courses practical. One of the most frequently given feedbacks is the diversity of topics and the inclusion of detailed information on the subject in the training. Can you tell our readers about some of your courses and why they should enroll for them? In my course titled “Child Psychology Socialization and Adaptation to School“, I wrote about how families can adapt their children to school during early childhood. This training is not only for families but also for the professionals in the field. Because I tried to convey the reactions of children against school in the early period from the perspective of psychology. Here, there is scientific background and general information and practices for the students who will enroll in the course. In the online training titled “Child Development: Toilet Training“, I cover toilet training in early childhood on the basis of in-depth knowledge. Many people tend to take a strict stance on toilet training of children. This is the most important stage of human development. That’s why I highly recommend this course to my students to understand toilet training and understand the important factors involved in it. What advice can you give someone who’s taking your courses to succeed? The courses are prepared in a balanced way with lecture notes and videos. In order to be successful in their education, I recommend them to watch the videos and take their own short notes. However, I recommend that they do it again and take notes over the lecture notes shared in the training. What has been your most important lesson or discovery when it comes to psychology and/or therapy? When it comes to psychology, what impressed me the most was the theory of information processing, which is the foundation of cognitive therapies. Information processing theories are a psychological theory that examines learning from a cognitive perspective. It was introduced in 1956 by the American Cognitive Psychologist George Armitage Miller. It examines the journey of knowledge between sensory, short and long memory. Because this theory is the most perfect example of our life. It is one of the most valuable theories that point to your yesterday, today and tomorrow! Students learn from their teachers/tutors. Any lessons you have learned from your students? I have been working in the online education industry for about 3 years. The most important thing students have taught me is, “Forget the best thing you thought you did, because you have the potential to do better.” I’ve never heard anything else that made me so happy and motivated, even from my academic advisors! My students know that producing and sharing knowledge is always valuable. What can Alison and its learners look forward to from you in the coming year to two? Alison and my students will see many issues affecting people around the world in my courses in the years to come. Although I plan to make these specifically for early childhood, I also plan to produce them in different fields. The pandemic has passed, but its effect still continues. As humanity, we must be more prepared for the next one. I think there are two issues that will affect humanity the most right now: the economic recession and the issues of war will significantly affect our lives. Therefore, I will consider these topics in my courses. In addition, they will learn about many issues that affect our current lives with great enthusiasm. Any last words, advice, or wisdom you’d like to share with our learners? Unless you increase your own level of knowledge and dominate your knowledge, you cannot discover yourself. A little headache, a little effort, and a little patience will get you in a much better place than you expected. And always TRUST YOURSELF.","length":18378,"tokens":3502,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Alison Publisher Spotlight: İlbey Ucar","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-publisher-spotlight-ilbey-ucar","essay_date":"Nov 23, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Understanding people, what drives people, makes them tick and do what they do underpins psychology.

Many situations that we think we are not affected spiritually can sometimes lead to traumatic results. As time passes, our body responds to us with the accumulations we experience spiritually. The process begins with the individual’s awareness of himself or being guided by his environment, becoming aware of his problems, and the desire to solve the troubled situation that he cannot get out of.

In my course titled “Child Psychology Socialization and Adaptation to School“, I wrote about how families can adapt their children to school during early childhood. This training is not only for families but also for the professionals in the field. Because I tried to convey the reactions of children against school in the early period from the perspective of psychology. Here, there is scientific background and general information and practices for the students who will enroll in the course. In the online training titled “Child Development: Toilet Training“, I cover toilet training in early childhood on the basis of in-depth knowledge. Many people tend to take a strict stance on toilet training of children. This is the most important stage of human development. That’s why I highly recommend this course to my students to understand toilet training and understand the important factors involved in it.","content_length":998,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Publisher Spotlight: İlbey Ucar","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-publisher-spotlight-ilbey-ucar","essay_date":"Nov 23, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"What advice can you give someone who’s taking your courses to succeed? The courses are prepared in a balanced way with lecture notes and videos. In order to be successful in their education, I recommend them to watch the videos and take their own short notes. However, I recommend that they do it again and take notes over the lecture notes shared in the training. What has been your most important lesson or discovery when it comes to psychology and/or therapy? When it comes to psychology, what impressed me the most was the theory of information processing, which is the foundation of cognitive therapies. Information processing theories are a psychological theory that examines learning from a cognitive perspective. It was introduced in 1956 by the American Cognitive Psychologist George Armitage Miller. It examines the journey of knowledge between sensory, short and long memory. Because this theory is the most perfect example of our life.","content_length":947,"content_tokens":177,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Publisher Spotlight: İlbey Ucar","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-publisher-spotlight-ilbey-ucar","essay_date":"Nov 23, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"It is one of the most valuable theories that point to your yesterday, today and tomorrow! Students learn from their teachers/tutors. Any lessons you have learned from your students? I have been working in the online education industry for about 3 years.

My students know that producing and sharing knowledge is always valuable. What can Alison and its learners look forward to from you in the coming year to two? Alison and my students will see many issues affecting people around the world in my courses in the years to come.

Many international corporations or companies looking to break into overseas markets will be inclined to hire employees with English listed as a language skill on their resume. Below, we have mock conversations in different settings that you can use to practice for real-life situations with your colleagues. Let’s have a conversation. Making small talk in the office Small talk is a kind of light-hearted informal conversation you have with someone you don’t know very well. It helps “break the ice” and fill the awkward silence that can happen in various settings. You can also use small talk in the workplace as an easy way to get to know your colleagues without worrying about saying something wrong. Here is an example of small talk at the office. Bob: Good morning. Jane: Good morning. Are you new? I haven’t seen you around the office before. Bob: No, I’m not new. I’ve been working here for four months. Jane: Which department do you work in? Bob: I’m in the IT department. Jane: IT sounds like an interesting job. Bob: It is. It can also be technical and requires long hours. Jane: With such long hours, were you able to watch the game this weekend? Bob: Unfortunately, not. I was working overtime. But I heard it was a great match. Jane: It was. And the weather was great too. Would you like a cup of coffee? Bob: Yes, please. I’d love a cup of coffee. In this short and basic conversation, Jane and Bob discussed three light topics: work, sports, and the weather. The more advanced your English-speaking skills, the more in-depth your small talk can get, like discussing the game and player technique and abilities. Getting help from IT Here is a mock conversation with Bill, who works in IT. Jane: Hi, Bob. How are you today? Bob: I am doing well, thank you. How can I help you today? Jane: I’m having a problem with my laptop. Will you be able to help? Bob: Sure, what seems to be the problem? Jane: My laptop screen is frozen. I powered it on and off to reboot, but now the screen is black and won’t switch on. Bob: Sure, no problem. I will come to your desk and assess what the problem could be. In this short conversation, Jane gets straight to the point in requesting help with her laptop. Her English skills have passed the beginner stage as she is now able to describe the problem in some detail using phrases like “powered” and “reboot” in the proper context. Setting up a meeting Meetings are a necessary part of work life. They can take place via Teams or in person. Sometimes meetings are quick catch-up sessions, and others are long collaborative sessions. You could be presenting or just a guest. Finding time in conflicting schedules and between tasks and deadlines can be challenging. In the scenario below, Jane and Sarah discuss the ideal time for a meeting to review Jane’s presentation. Sarah: Hi Jane, how are you today? Jane: I’m doing well, thanks, Sarah. How are you? Sarah: Great, thanks for asking. How’s your schedule this week? Jane: I have several meetings and a few tasks to complete this week. Sarah: Okay, please check your schedule and my calendar availability, and when you find a gap, book the time for us. Jane: I have a hybrid schedule, so I’m not in the office every day. Does it have to be in person? Sarah: Ideally, yes. I’m in the office all week, and I’d like to meet next time you’re here as well. Jane: Sure. Have I done anything wrong? Sarah: We need to discuss a few matters regarding the presentation you gave earlier today. How to give and receive feedback Giving and receiving feedback is a big part of any job. Unfortunately, it’s not always easy to give feedback or be on the receiving end. However, you can maintain a positive tone even in these critical conversations. Below, Sarah and Jane are meeting so Sarah can give Jane feedback on her presentation. Sarah: Jane, thanks for making time to come and see me. As I mentioned, I’d like to talk to you about the presentation you gave to the team and client earlier. Jane: Okay. Sarah: Your contribution to the presentation seemed disorganised and rushed. Many of the team members could not follow what you were saying. Jane: What do you mean? Was I unclear about anything? Sarah: You are an eloquent speaker and know your work very well. However, the client has expressed their dissatisfaction with your presentation and said that the strategies you presented were unclear, and you provided no research to support your strategies and plan going forward. Jane: It’s just that there’s a lot going on, and I worked late all week to meet my deadlines. This was too much for me to do in time. Sarah: Okay, I understand. Next time, please let the team know if you are under pressure and unable to prepare a presentation. We are a team that supports each other. Jane: I know everyone is busy, and I wasn’t sure they’d be able to help. Sarah: I understand that, but it’s always better to ask than assume. Doing otherwise makes the team look unprofessional. Jane: Will I receive any disciplinary action? Sarah: No, not disciplinary, but Peter will be taking the lead on the project going forward, and you will take on a more supportive role. This will allow you to focus your attention on less demanding tasks and give you the opportunity to find time management tools and presentation skills for future projects. Jane: I understand Sarah. Thank you for letting me know. In this conversation, you will notice the advanced use of English phrases and sentence structure. This level of conversation is an example of someone who has a fluent grasp of the language. Their level of comprehension, speaking, and listening level allows Sarah to use more descriptive terminology in the feedback session. Read our helpful guide on how to give and receive feedback.

What this means is that there is something for everyone. Similarly, when it comes to careers, the familiar that we hear about every day, or the more obscure career paths we wouldn’t think of like a mattress tester (talk about a dream job), there is someone out there who is made for that position. For some people, finding a career they will spend years in is easy. Not so for many others. National Career Development Month is the perfect opportunity to stop, assess and find out what type of lid you are and what kind of pot you fit on. We’re here to help. National Career Development Month (USA) November is National Career Development Month. Since its inception in 1999 by the National Career Development Association, NCDM has worked to promote career development, growth, and planning for people of all ages. November provides you with the opportunity to assess all aspects of your journey. Many people don’t realise that their career is in their hands. It can be challenging and indeed sometimes easier to just go with the flow and get any paycheck. But for the number of years, you will spend in a job, it’s worthwhile to take time and own your career development. What is career development? Career development refers to the various actions an individual can do to charter their career path. It’s a structured process that individual’s use to choose a career, enhance their skills, and move forward on the chosen career path. This is a tailored strategy that focuses on matching an employee’s skills and abilities to the tasks of an organisation. It’s a lifelong process that involves learning, evolving, and aligning one’s personal needs with their physical or psychological needs. Why career development is important The biggest reason career development is important is because well, it’s your career. If you’re not growing, you’re dying.

They work on wind turbines, dams, kilns, foundries, high-rise buildings, and steel mills with hot flaming temperatures while exposed to many occupational hazards. If their employers do not consider these workplace hazards, they can increase the possibility of their workers getting injured. At times, these occupational hazards can even cost these workers their lives. Here, it is pertinent to mention that whenever we talk about occupational hazards, usually the most dangerous locations (such as those mentioned above) come into our minds. But unfortunately, these occupational hazards are not limited to these types of workplaces only. Workspaces, such as offices that are generally considered safe, also present a lot of hazards to employees and workers working there. Companies usually hire occupational safety professionals and officers to manage the hazards. These officers ensure that workplaces and employers in their jurisdictions abide by local laws and regulations related to occupational safety. Regulators can also impose penalties on employers who violate these laws and regulations. The occupational health and safety professionals have different layers and roles based on their knowledge, experience and competence. Some companies use officers based on low risk level while some companies have a big department managing occupational health and safety risks. The roles are in the layers of Director Health & Safety to several senior managers then managers then finally officers and finally worker level people supporting the health and safety operations. What your Role as an Occupational Safety Officer is As an occupational safety professional, your role is vital for any workplace willing to operate efficiently while following the local occupational safety laws.

It’s a season that brings guests, travel (if you’re lucky), shopping, sleep-ins, and quality time with friends and family. But planning for the holiday season isn’t as idyllic or carefree as we want it to be. In many cases, it comes with anxiety, depression, feelings of loneliness, pressure, and financial stresses, to name a few. We’ve put together a guide to help you get through the upcoming holiday season. International Stress Awareness Week International Stress Awareness Week (7-11 November) was established in 2018 to highlight the need for stress awareness and its management. Building resilience and reducing stress are this year’s topics to engage in conversation between individuals and businesses. The hope is that through these dialogues, the stigma around stress and mental health will be heard and resources made more accessible to all who need it. But with stress so rampant and affecting everyone at home and at work, how to manage stress can be lifesaving. Here are a few practical ways to get you through the holidays with as little stress as possible. Effects of Holiday Stress Work, family, health, and finances are all factors that can lead to our stress levels being heightened. Stress affects everyone differently. Thus, it’s important for us to minimize chronic stress due to its effects on one’s overall health. Headaches Weight gain Hypertension Body aches Reduces cognitive and learning abilities Practical Guide to Stress Management over the Holidays Unfortunately, for some, the holiday season can have an emotional toll. And at the height of the stress levels and situations, it can be difficult to stop, center yourself and find help. Self-check-in If you struggle with stress and mental health, it’s important that you learn your triggers. Your inner emotions and personal struggles are highlighted during the season because in many ways, life “quietens down”. Know when you need to take time to be alone. Discover what helps you get back to “yourself”. Do more of what make you happy. Plan ahead This means planning your holiday travel ahead of time. Book your flight tickets, travel dates, and itinerary as well as your possible can. Planning also relates to your finances. Decide how much you have to spend for food, clothes, gifts, and travel. Swiping your card and spending more than you have can cause financial stress. Create a budget and stick as close to it as possible and make room for unexpected costs. Homemade gifts or secret Santa gifting on a budget Book tickets ahead of time (more affordable) Buy one new outfit and not a new closet Buy what you will eat, need, and use. Have help at hand The holiday season can make some individuals feel lonely and isolated, even when they’re with people. Sometimes it’s those closest to us who can trigger our mental health and add to the stress the season brings. During this time, you can feel isolated and without anyone to love and support you. But it’s important to know where to get help when you feel low. Join an online support group Seek out a community Find a contact if your therapist isn’t available Volunteer at a home or center Broaden your friendship circle When the need arises, pick up the phone and call. Say no Saying “no” is not as easy for some people as it is for others. But it’s a very necessary skill to learn. “Unfestive” as it may seem to others, it’s as good a time to learn how to say no as any. You’ll be relieved to know that the world will not stop if you say no and although some may be upset for a minute, people very quickly move on and make alternative plans. Saying no is a great way to establish your boundaries and ensures that others do as much work as you do. Maintain your healthy habits It’s easy to get lost in the spirit of the season and the festivities that you let go off the healthy habits you built so hard over the year. When this happens, the loss of routine and structure can result in you feeling lost and overwhelmed by everything that’s happening. Keep up your exercise routine. Or start one. Try maintaining your healthy diet. Keep as close to your sleep schedule as possible. Overindulging can add to your stress, guilt, and anxiety. Avoid excess and reduce the time you spend on things that drain your energy. Instead, have fun. Create memories. Be aware of your triggers and make use of the support resources around you and put them into action before the downward spiral. “The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another,” William James.

A lot of what holds us back is how we think about ourselves and our circumstances. Do you have a negative attitude, self-belief or insecurities that have held you back? If you aren’t sure, schedule a session with a therapist to help you introspect on your thinking habits. This is a good way to begin preparing how you’ll go into the new year. Celebrate your wins. Stop. Look back. And celebrate. We spend so much time on the go and moving onto the next one, we don’t stop to celebrate wins, big and small, along the way. Review your year and pat yourself on the back for the things you managed to achieve. Redefine your goals. As the year has progressed, things have changed. Take some time to evaluate where you are, what you want to do and if these goals are still aligned with your path. Declutter. Carrying unnecessary weight and baggage is heavy. Clean out your closet, your contact list, unused apps, and items that you like the idea of having but just aren’t using. This will help you make room for the new. Accomplish one last big thing. Identify that one thing you’ve been meaning to start but you put off. And do it. Make the call. Write that business plan. Push ahead with the knowledge that doing it will give you that proud, relieved, and excited feeling. Begin setting your objectives for 2023. It’s never too early to start planning for the new year. If 2022 is anything to go by, the months go by quickly. Start thinking about the coming year and what you will need to do to help you achieve those personal and professional objectives. Help somebody. “It’s better to give than to receive.” This is a common saying that does as much for you, the giver, as it does for the receiver. Helping others is a reminder that there’s more to life than our issues. There’s a great satisfaction in knowing you have helped someone achieve something. And it also gives you a sense of purpose. Something we all seek. Questions To Ask Yourself By now you realise that the things you need to do to help you finish the year strong look the same as the things you planned to do over the course of the year. What you need is time, which at this point in the year, doesn’t seem to be on your side. But the good news is, the year isn’t over yet. You still have time. You look back on the year and ahead to what’s left of the year, ask yourself a few important questions: What has gone well? What small things kept you from achieving the big things? Is your health, family, finances as strong as you’d like them to be? What held you back? What kept you going? What are you most grateful for? What has been your biggest takeaway of 2022? What have you learned about yourself? Looking Ahead to 2023 and Beyond It’s fun to sit, dream and imagine what life would be like if you could do ABC. We have good intentions and set goals and plan when we want to achieve them. What we neglect doing is putting down the tools and steps you need to take to ensure you achieve those goals. That can seem like the hard part. But it really isn’t when you consider that goals are made up of several elements: Results. What do you want to achieve? Actions. What actions do you need to do to achieve your goals? Time. How much time do you have to accomplish your set goals? Motivation. When the going gets tough, what will keep you going? How will you motivate yourself to make sure you do all you set yourself out to do? Write down your action plan in bite-sized portions and formulate steps you need to take, you set yourself up a win. The best time to start anything was yesterday. The second-best time is today. That’s 8 weeks and 5 days until 31st December. This gives you just enough time to get one more thing started. Or finish off that task you’ve been struggling to tick off your list. If you do this, you will not only finish the year on a strong note, but you also set yourself up for a great start to the coming year. Remember, “Year’s end is neither an end nor a beginning but a going on, with all the wisdom that experience can instill in us.” – Hal Borland","length":5108,"tokens":1198,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"7 Ways to Finish the Year Strong","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/7-ways-to-finish-the-year-strong","essay_date":"Nov 1, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"It feels like just yesterday when we were welcoming the new year and looking ahead to 2022.

The ones whose words stay with us long after the ink has dried. These individuals know not just how to tell a story but weave it in such a way that you feel invited to be a part of the story. It’s an undeniable skill and talent and we’re shining our industry spotlight on the copywriter. We speak to Kim Mlangeni, a copywriter and businessowner, to tell us more about the industry and everything aspiring copywriters need to know before stepping through the doors. My introduction to copywriting Please tell us a bit about yourself. My name is Kim Mlangeni. I work at BlackSwan as a Mid-Weight to Senior Copywriter. I’ve been in the copywriting industry for seven-eight years. I’m a mom, a sister, a friend, a lover. I enjoy discovering new spots. I am a foodie. I love to laugh. Laughter is more than medicine to me. It’s my soul-keeper. How did you get into copywriting? I got into copywriting through a journalism internship I did back in 2014-2015 and I fell in love with the art of writing. My career evolved from there to where I was an online editor for a TV channel and then it grew from there. Life as a copywriter What does the day-to-day life of a copywriter look like? At the moment I work for an agency so day-to-day revolves around pushing out content in terms of whatever the brief is. Let’s say, if we are working on a new campaign and some of the elements of the campaign are radio, emailers, social media, and billboards. We would then look at the ‘chase list’. This is a list that tells you when and what flights when. If a client has told us that emailers go out first, the day-to-day would be rolling out those emailers. Or, if we need to brainstorm a new campaign, we’d read the brief, huddle as a team, brainstorm and then meet to discuss ideas. We see what we can put down, we find imagery that speaks to the idea and words that speak to the idea and we build from there. Not only am I a copywriter, but I’m also a conceptual copywriter or I’m an integrative copywriter, which puts me into different spheres. I don’t just write e-mails. I write social media posts. I brainstorm ideas. I brainstorm campaigns. I work with a production team. I roll out advertisements. I roll out billboards. What was the most surprising thing you learned about being a copywriter? I think the most surprising thing I learned about being a copywriter is the power of the copy that I write. Sometimes you write so much copy that for you it becomes just a “job”, but you don’t understand the impact that the emailer or radio script has on the lives of somebody who reads it or listens to it. So, I think that was the most surprising thing for me, when I met someone who had engaged with a piece of copy I had written and they said, “Wow, what you wrote really changed my life and it helped my future.” The work I do is quite amazing. What was the biggest lesson you learned in your career as a copywriter? The biggest lesson I learned in my career is not to take my voice for granted. Being black and female and wanting to come into a white-dominated space, a lot of times you would feel you need to close yourself off or let other people lead and you follow them. What I have to say matters. What I have to say is valid because not only am I putting this on paper, but I have heard testimonies from people that what I am doing is “life-changing”. For aspiring copywriters What words of advice can you give someone who wants to be a copywriter? Don’t come into copywriting because you just want a job. You don’t just sit at a desk and write. While there is copywriting like that, but that’s not the kind I do. You have to be passionate about being one. My advice to someone who wants to be a copywriter, is based on where I am in my career. “Don’t just be a copywriter because you can write a few sentences. You must be really passionate about it.” What skills should every aspiring copywriter have? You need to have a way with words. You need to be a quick thinker. You need to always be on your feet. You need to keep your ears on the ground and listen to trends, listen to what’s out there, what people are engaging with because when you write, you need to write a piece that engages with people now and not “then”. The art of writing and writers What are the big misconceptions about copywriters? The biggest misconception about copywriters is that we are well paid. LOL. The biggest misconception about copywriters is that we think we are ‘know-it-alls’. No. We are just people who take the extra step to research and look into more detail at the information we want to bring across and give to people. Is writer’s block real and if so, how do you overcome it? Writer’s block is a real thing. There’s nothing worse than experiencing writer’s block when you have a deadline. How do I overcome writer’s block? I usually step away from whatever I am working on. I focus my attention on something else. If I am working on my PC, I stop and get a paper and a pen and jot my ideas down. I try and string some sentences together and build that way. In my writer’s block, I don’t just sit with it, I try and work my way out of it. What gets your creative writing juices flowing? I love a good and exciting campaign. I love youth-driven products. I love anything that speaks to me or generations younger than me. I love informing and educating. I love something that I can relate to. Becoming a copywriter What should one look forward to when entering the job market as a copywriter? Don’t expect people to love you at first glance. Don’t expect people to understand your style of writing at first read. Sometimes you find yourself in a space where people are so in tune or engraved in their way that they don’t see your style as something that their audience can relate to you. Sometimes it’s not what they are looking for, and they want someone who will write in a boring style. That’s just the way the cookie crumbles. What’s the biggest challenge you have faced as a copywriter? One of the biggest challenges faced being a copywriter is feeling validated and feeling like what I say matters. As I spoke about earlier, sometimes you write something, and your seniors will make you feel like they could have written it themself. But that’s my personal interpretation of what I thought I needed to do. The biggest challenge is feeling like I’m not heard, or my feelings don’t matter. Career paths copywriters What are the career paths available for a copywriter? You get your mainstream copywriter. You get your conceptual copywriter. Scriptwriters, song writers. There are different types of copywriting streams you can go into. It’s now taking me to art and creative directing. There are different channels you can move towards and into. Final words What are some of the tips to survive and thrive as a copywriter? Stand your ground. Don’t dim your light or shine. You will get naysayers who think you are too forward, or the writing style doesn’t interest the masses. It’s not in tune with what we want. But stick to your guns. Sharpen your craft. Every single chance you get – sharpen. Learn. Find out what is out there. Try and go the extra mile. Also, pen to paper. Jot things down. Make notes. Sometimes, try to focus on the main thing and then show how the other smaller things and ideas came about. Interested in becoming copywriter?

Just like that, you have learned how to say hello in seven languages. Learning a new language can seem daunting at first but if you can learn pottery, meditation, and how to play an instrument online, why not a new language? So, whether you want to travel, have dreams of working for an international conglomerate, or just enjoy learning something new, we’re giving you the top seven languages you should learn and why. Why you should learn a new language There are many good reasons why you should learn a new language. You can read more about the benefits and tips to learning a new language here. The top reasons we shared in this article are: Improved career prospects Makes you a better multi-tasker Improves your memory Makes you a better communicator Helps you learn about and appreciate other cultures But which language do you start with? Keep reading. We’ve outlined the top languages you can consider learning. The Top 7 Languages You Should Learn There are thousands of languages (over 7000) in the world. They are spoken among different continents, countries, nationalities, and tribes. Many of these languages are becoming endangered with fewer speakers remaining and not many people passing the language onto coming generations. However, about 23 languages are spoken by more than half of the world’s population. Mandarin Chinese China is one of the world’s top economies. It’s a global powerhouse and given its reach across all corners of the globe, it’s to be expected that it’s a top language to learn. Mandarin Chinese is spoken by 1.3 billion (yes, with a “b”) native speakers. That means roughly one-in-seven of the world’s population speaks Mandarin, a rather impressive statistic considering the size of the world. However, it’s not an easy language to learn with the various pronunciations and tones you need to master to help you eliminate your accent. But if you want to explore international business opportunities, you’ll be one up on many people also seeking global work opportunities. French France isn’t the only country in the world where French is la langue officielle. It is, in fact, the official language in 11 African countries. It’s estimated that there are just under 240 million native French speakers today. Oui, it is the language of love. And you’ll love it even more as an English -native speaker because it’s one of the easier languages to learn. In future, the number of people who can speak French is expected to rise as this romance language group tongue gains popularity. Italian Italian is the language of fashion, art, delectable cuisine, and music. It ticks all the right boxes in terms of the best foreign language to learn but for native English speakers, Italian is considered one of the easiest languages to learn. So, if you just want to know how to speak the language to help you as you travel and eat your way through its beautiful cities, you’ll be proficient in no time. But, if you want to add that something extra to your repertoire in the design, luxury cars, culture and fine arts spaces, Italian is a great language for you to learn. Spanish If you find yourself in Europe, or in any of the countries in South America, you can put your Spanish language skills with the 480 million speakers globally. In fact, even if you venture into the United States, you will find over 35 million native-Spanish speakers from east to west. This will provide you with every ample opportunity to practice your Spanish speaking skills.

At the core of Alison is a desire to empower people through education. Through learning, individuals are able to change their lives, that of their families and communities. The good news is that Alison is a free online learning platform that can change the course of your life. You can help spread the news through our Affiliate Programme to those in your online world. We sat down with Marian Cremin, who leads Alison’s Affiliate Programme to have your Alison Affiliate FAQs answered. Keep reading to learn more about the programme and find out how and why you can be a part of something that will empower you and those you know. Please introduce yourself to Alison readers. My name is Marian, I’m from Ireland and I have been working at Alison for the last 1.5 years as a Business Analyst and Project Manager. One of the biggest projects I have been working on lately is the Alison Affiliate Programme. What is an Affiliate Programme? Often when people enjoy something that they have purchased they will recommend that product to their friends or family. Well, an Affiliate Programme is exactly this, but you are financially rewarded for recommending a product or service to others. How does Alison’s Affiliate Programme work? At Alison we provide free courses and tools to people worldwide. An Alison Affiliate is someone who enjoys our platform and wants to recommend it to others while getting paid to do so. Therefore, they share links to the different resources we provide, for example a particular course or maybe a tool such as our Resume Builder. When someone on the internet clicks on the Affiliate’s link, signs-up to Alison and generates revenue, we pay the Affiliate 20%. Basically, an Affiliate gets paid for recommending Alison to others, therefore empowering others educationally while empowering themselves financially, it’s a win-win. What should people look for in a reputable Affiliate programme and how does someone then become an Affiliate marketer? In general, you should first think about the websites that you love using. If you want to become an Affiliate Marketer and promote products and services, it is important that you have tried these yourself and believe they are worth recommending to others. Once you have found the website you want to promote, check that they have an Affiliate Programme and ensure that the payment process suits your needs. Sometimes Affiliates are paid for their efforts while other times the company offers the Affiliate discount vouchers. At Alison, we pay our Affiliates, and they receive their earnings in instalments of 100 euro. Once you have found an Affiliate Programme that suits your needs you can register to become an Affiliate on the company’s website. On Alison, you can do so here. Do you need qualifications to join Alison’s Affiliate programme? No, you don’t need any qualifications to become an Alison Affiliate, there is no application process so you can join the Affiliate Programme with just a click of a button. What support does Alison offer its Affiliates? We provide Alison Affiliates with a Marketing Toolkit because we acknowledge that not all Affiliates are experienced marketers. This is basically their go-to guide which contains tips and tricks to get the most out of the programme. They can find suggestions on which links to share and how to utilise different online platforms to promote their links, from LinkedIn to TikTok to Email Marketing, our Alison marketing experts put together a comprehensive guide on how to do it all. Alison Affiliates have also been provided with a template pack where they can use images created by our design team to post on social media alongside their Affiliate link. Not only do we provide our Affiliates with a Marketing Toolkit but we are also in the process of developing a new Affiliate Dashboard with cool features such as an interactive graph to track stats and a performance breakdown of the links they have previously shared so they can see what courses and tools their audience engages with the most. We are constantly finding ways to improve the Alison Affiliate Programme so we can make it an enjoyable experience for our members. What can Affiliates do to become successful in the programme? Numbers never lie – track your stats! This is the Business Analyst coming out in me, but I do think the best way to succeed is to figure out what story your stats are telling you. The people who are clicking your Affiliates links, do they come from a certain country? Did more people enrol and complete a course that you shared in IT compared to when you shared a course in Health? Are more people clicking on your Affiliate links on a weekday vs a weekend? Every time you post an Affiliate link you should ask yourself these types of questions and use the answers to guide your strategy. Everything is about trial and error, but the hardest part is figuring out the most optimal combination to achieve high conversions. What are some common mistakes Affiliates make? One of the biggest mistakes an Affiliate can make is not understanding their audience. It is so important to post content that your followers will find engaging. Whether you post Affiliate links on social media, in a personal blog, on an online forum or in a WhatsApp group, you must ensure you are tailoring the links you share and the accompanying messaging so that it is relevant and interesting to those viewing your content. For example, you probably don’t have the same conversations with your grandmother that you have with your best friend because you understand appropriate ways of communicating with the different people you socially interact with. Affiliate marketing is understanding online social cues and in response tailoring how you speak to people on the internet. Be personable, helpful and don’t view every online interaction as an opportunity for a sales pitch. How can people know if the Alison Affiliate Programme is the ‘right fit’ for them? There is no drawback to joining the Affiliate Programme, it’s quick and free to become an Alison Affiliate and we provide you with free resources to help you get the most out of the programme. If the programme interests you but you are on the fence about joining, just know there is no commitment, you can try it out and even make some money along the way while you figure out if the programme is the right fit for you. What challenges do most people face as an Affiliate? Sometimes Affiliates just don’t know where to start. They have joined an Affiliate Programme, they have generated Affiliate links for the pages they want to share but then they don’t know how to go about promoting these links online. Or often, Affiliates are unsure of which links to share in the first place. It can be overwhelming for people so that’s why we created an Affiliate Marketing Toolkit to guide Affiliates, giving tips for every step of the Affiliate process. What courses or programmes should one take to become a better Affiliate? I think one of the best courses an Affiliate can do and seems to be quite popular amongst our members of the Affiliate Programme is the free course called Master Affiliate Marketing With this Step-by-Step Guide. Having said that, there are also great courses specific to marketing on different platforms for example courses to learn more about YouTube Marketing or Twitter Marketing or general courses such as an Introduction to Advertising or Entrepreneurship. There are a large number of free courses which Affiliates can take to upskill and improve their performance. What do you say to someone who isn’t “big” or active on social media but would like to be an Alison affiliate? You definitely don’t need to be a social media Guru to become an Alison Affiliate. There are many platforms where you can share your Affiliate links such as WhatsApp, Online forums like Quora, you could even share courses via email with work colleagues who are looking to upskill. One of our expert marketers actually put together a guide for Affiliates on how to utilise these platforms to their advantage. What is an Affiliate disclosure statement and do Alison Affiliates need to sign one? An Affiliate disclosure statement is basically a disclaimer where the Affiliate is transparent with their audience, indicating that they are receiving commission for promoting a specific brand. The Affiliate doesn’t need to sign anything, but they do need to highlight their Affiliate relationship on the platform where they are sharing their Affiliate links. What are some interesting trends in the global Affiliate industry? Short-form video content is becoming more and more popular with many Affiliates taking advantage of platforms such as TikTok and Instagram Reels to generate leads. It is estimated that TikTok users spend approximately $110 million per month indicating that those using the App are impressionable and willing to spend. There has also been a shift towards greater sustainability with 54% of Gen Z consumers willing to pay an extra 10% for more sustainable products. At Alison we acknowledge the importance of leading a sustainable lifestyle and therefore make courses pertaining to this subject area readily available to learners worldwide. People can find courses on Environmental Sustainability, Climate Change and even courses on following a Vegan Diet, all of which Affiliates can promote to help educate their audience. Any last words for those interested in becoming an Alison Affiliate? We strongly believe in providing people around the world with the resources they need to empower themselves in their personal and professional lives. By spreading the word of Alison, you can help us achieve our goal of helping others while being rewarded financially yourself through the Affiliate Programme. We also want our Affiliates to enjoy the experience and have fun so we have lots of new features due to be released over the coming months which our Alison Affiliates will get exclusive access to.

In general, you should first think about the websites that you love using. If you want to become an Affiliate Marketer and promote products and services, it is important that you have tried these yourself and believe they are worth recommending to others. Once you have found the website you want to promote, check that they have an Affiliate Programme and ensure that the payment process suits your needs. Sometimes Affiliates are paid for their efforts while other times the company offers the Affiliate discount vouchers. At Alison, we pay our Affiliates, and they receive their earnings in instalments of 100 euro. Once you have found an Affiliate Programme that suits your needs you can register to become an Affiliate on the company’s website.

The engineering field is where critical thinkers and problem-solvers unite to explore how things work and find practical solutions to science’s discoveries. This month, we’re shining our Alison Publisher Spotlight on Graham Van Brunt. He spoke to us about his engineering experience and how he has taken his Power Systems Protection Training from the floor and into the virtual space. Please share with our learners a bit about your background. I graduated from Queen’s University as an electrical engineer specialising in power. I spent the first 25 years of my career as a protection and control engineer with Ontario Hydro. Subsequently as a Director of Operations and Maintenance with Churchill Falls Labrador Corporation. I then worked for and then retired from Siemens Canada. How did you get into teaching? I started teaching early in my career as a continuing education instructor for Confederation College in Thunder Bay, Ontario. I spent two years establishing a training school for technologists and engineers in protection and control in Tarbela, Pakistan, set up by CIDA (Canadian International Development Agency). I also worked for Georgian College, in Barrie Ontario as an electrical instructor. For those just learning about you, please tell us more about Power Systems Protection Training. I am an electrical engineer with over 35 years of experience in the field, included in that as an instructor. My forte is related to electrical power. Although retired, I keep in contact by providing a series of modules that I am in the process of delivering via streaming videos on over 21 platforms internationally. What’s your take on online learning when looking at the future? Online learning has been available for quite some time, but as of late, there has been an exponential pick up of online training. It definitely is the way of the future for training. How has being a self-publisher on Alison changed or impacted your life? Being a self-publisher has allowed me to reach an international student volume. I have switched from in person training which reaches at most only a couple of dozen students at a time to streaming my courses online and reaching thousands of students continuously. How should learner’s approach remote video tutoring and learning? Students should search specifically for the courses that they are interested in. The engineering sub-discipline is widespread. Can you share with our prospective learners what the potential for growth and longevity is in this field? Technology today is changing at a very rapid pace. The sub-discipline of engineering is no different, especially in the field of electrical engineering. Regardless of what type of engineering you intend to learn, it’s important to get a solid foundation in the basics. Who should take your courses? My courses are structured to fit a wide variety of students. Entry-level students will find my basic courses as well as the advanced courses easy to understand and succinctly laid out. They are also structured for the advanced engineers that want to take more advanced subjects or do a quick review of the basics. How would you advise learners to master precision throughout their studies online? Learners are poised to proceed slowly through the videos, and it would be a good idea to halt the video and back up and review any difficult areas. It is also advisable to jot down notes as you go along. Please share with our readers about your courses on Alison. My courses are primarily about electrical power. They range in difficulty from the simple entry level topics such as DC circuits to the more advanced subject matter such as three phase fault analysis. What feedback have you received from learners about your course? What do people enjoy most about your courses? The feedback from students has been almost 100% positive, putting my evaluation of my courses between 4.5 and 5 stars out of 5. How will your courses help enrich the lives of those who take them? My courses are designed to bridge the gap between book learning and the experience the student will obtain once in the field. They are predicated on the challenges that I experienced while learning to become an electrical engineer. For individuals interested in taking one of your courses, what can they expect to get from it? Students can expect to get a good foundation in the fundamentals of what is needed to become proficient in the power electrical field. What words of advice would you give someone who would like to become a publisher on Alison? Select a niche that you are proficient and excited to work in. Build courses related to that niche using PowerPoint (Windows) or Keynote (Mac). Both allow voiceover then to convert the presentation to a video format. What has been your most important lesson or discovery when it comes to online education programmes? The world is your institution of teaching. What career paths are available for someone interested in pursuing your courses? Electrical/mechanical maintenance, electrician, electrical/mechanical technologist, electrical/mechanical engineer. How would your courses enrich the professional lives of those who take them? These courses act as reference books or material for any professional. Students learn from their teachers/tutors. Any lessons you have learned from your students? Absolutely! I have learned from my students, in fact I look forward to interacting with them, and learning new approaches.

If you’re giving feedback, it feels uncomfortable. As much as we may not enjoy it, feedback is a necessary part of our growth. Keep reading to learn how to give and receive feedback. What Is Feedback? Feedback is a two-way communication system where a sender delivers a message to a receiver that is to be interpreted. It is the response given by the receiver after perceiving a message. Bartol & Martin define feedback as “…the receiver’s basic response to the interpreted message”. It is a peer-to-peer interaction and while it is primarily used in the workplace or school (reports), it can also be found and used in personal relationships and settings outside the office. The Benefits of Feedback Feedback is a vital communication process of any development. It set a good foundation for an effective performance management system for companies. When feedback is given and received well, it can result in phenomenal changes between the individuals, the organisation, and how it operates. Improved performance. Individuals have a clear understanding of what is expected of them. This allows them to develop skills and stretch themselves. Increased employee engagement. Employees become more active and interested in their advancement and will be more open to doing regular check-ins to assess their progress. Motivation tool. Effective feedback and communication drives staff to reach individual goals and work harder together to achieve team and company objectives. Keeps track of goals. Actionable targets given to individuals in feedback sessions create a clear target to aim for. This also makes it easier to achieve as the worker knows what steps they need to take. Feedback enhances growth. “Unlearn to learn”. The goal of feedback is to promote individual, team, and an organisation’s growth. Effective feedback has great benefits that can contribute to individual and organizational success. How to Give Feedback At its core, feedback should focus on quality sessions and check-ins and focus less on the number of sessions you have. These sessions need to be focused, actionable and effective. Whatever capacity you’re in that requires you to give feedback, you need the right tools to ensure your message lands with the receiver. The OILS Framework is a powerful and structured tool that can be used to give and receive feedback. Let’s explore further below. Observation. The first step is to frame the feedback from an objective standpoint. You should also refer to a specific event or time. Impact/Interpretation. Here, you explain how the event and the actions affected you – how you felt or behaved. Listen. This step invites the receiver to contribute to the exchange and provide context, an apology, or an explanation for their behaviour. This will also allow the receiver to be an active participant in the dialogue and not feel like they are being ‘spoken at’ instead of being ‘spoken with/to’. Suggestion. The last technique in the framework brings it all together. As the giver, you can provide some thoughts and suggestions on the next steps to take and how best to move forward. You can come up with an action plan with things you both can do for a better outcome. OILS is a simple yet powerful framework for effective feedback. How to Receive Feedback We would all rather not hear any negative feedback relating to our performance in any area. However, an inability to tolerate feedback is an inability to allow yourself personal growth. We need to recognise that all feedback, when given properly, can be received openly and with an understanding that it’s an opportunity to grow in certain areas. Be open. Hearing feedback is not the brightest part of anyone’s day. It is however important to remain open to hear the feedback. Good or bad, receive and then decide on how you will proceed with what has been given to you. Be an active listener. During the feedback session, try to repeat and affirm what you have heard. This active listening skill allows you to hear the truth, no matter how hard, without being defensive. It ensures you’ve heard what is being said and not the emotions that comes with it. Review. Request clarity. Ask questions. Take time to process what was discussed and come back for a follow-up conversation, if necessary. S. I. F. T through the feedback. The SIFT acronym means you should consider the source (who is the feedback coming from), impact (what is the impact of the feedback given), frequency (is this something you hear often or is it the first time the issue is being raised) and trends (is this feedback coming from work, home, school or other) from your feedback session. If you feel that there are skills gaps in your resume and highlighted areas that you could grow in, building your resume can pinpoint these areas. Learning how to give and receive feedback is an ongoing process that requires practice and a healthy dose of honesty. But it can get better over time. It’s a two-way street that needs to be given and received constructively for lasting change and impact.","length":5169,"tokens":1054,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"How to Give and Receive Feedback","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/how-to-give-and-receive-feedback","essay_date":"Oct 13, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"When we think, let alone hear the term “feedback”, we can become paralyzed at the thought of what we’ll hear about our performance.

Little or no attention was paid to Mental health. Ignoring mental health can have devastating effects on your overall wellness. The good news is that in recent years, there is more attention paid to mental health and many conversations are being had about debilitating mental illnesses and their effects. Now more than ever, it’s time to make mental health a priority. Understanding mental health Mental health and illness are general terms used to describe several psychological disorders. These include, but are not limited to anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. What are the benefits of having good mental health? When we are mentally strong and healthy, we enjoy a good quality of life and what it has to offer. We are more productive, feel more fulfilled, we are expectant, optimistic, creative, and open to living. We are also better equipped to cope when dark times come, and difficult situations arise. Positive self-image Healthy relationships A healthy work-life balance Increased learning, creativity Reduced risk of depression The past few years have been challenging for people’s mental and emotional health, to say the least. The knock-on challenges and effects of the pandemic had a significant impact on many people – and the lasting effects are still evident today. We can get so busy trying to survive the various storms that we don’t take care of our mental health. But it’s time to make our mental health a priority. 8 Ways to Make Mental Health a Priority Our mental health influences how we think, and feel, how we handle situations, and the choices we make. We need to realise that our mental health plays in our everyday life and affects every area of our lives. This stresses the need to prioritise it more than ever. Here are a few ways you can make your mental health a priority. Move. The mind and body are linked. Physical exercise releases happy hormones, endorphins, that give you energy and improve your mood. ‘moving’ doesn’t necessarily mean pumping iron and lifting weights in the gym. Dance, yoga, hiking, cycling, or going for a walk every day – whatever your idea of a great time, do it. Get support. We were not created to do life alone. Not everyone is fortunate to have family or friends close by or that they can confide in. However, cultivating a solid support system for yourself is key. Join support groups if you can and make friends who will be able to support you through your hard seasons. Seek help. Despite the stigma attached to mental health, there is no shame in asking for help when you need it. Seeking help doesn’t make you weak. If anything, it’s a sign of strength. “It may sound paradoxical, but strength comes from vulnerability” – Barack Obama Educate yourself on mental health. It’s important to know what mental health is and isn’t. Knowing the signs, symptoms, triggers, and other vital information arms you with knowledge about what you can do to begin your healing. Practice self-care. Self-care is not just lying in a bubble bath with a face mask and lit candles. It’s giving your body what it needs to function at its best. Become friends with your body, eat well, set goals for yourself, and limit stress. If you don’t pick a day to relax, your body will pick it for you. Rest. Don’t be too busy to rest. Sleep is that golden chain that ties health and our bodies together. Try to set and keep to a strict sleep schedule. You will wake up fresh and with the energy to tackle the day ahead. Set boundaries. When you say ‘yes’ to everything, you’re also saying yes to the time, energy and effort required for that task or activity. Know your limits and the capacity you must take on more of anything. Learn how to say “no”. Reduce screen time. Phones, TV, laptops. It seems we don’t know how to switch off. This is not to say don’t watch your favourite TV shows, or movies or see what your friends are up to on social media. These are all ways of unwinding too, but it’s important to know when to stop scrolling and spend time with people in real life. Draw the line between real and fake. Mot everything you see on social media is real – well all know that. Be cognisant of what you consume and how it could make you doubt the beauty of your life or pressure you into thinking you’re not doing as well as someone’s highlight reel. What we consume can consume us. No one is immune to the harsh realities of life. This can be our friends, family, neighbours, or even colleagues. Mental health issues have no regard for age, race, creed, or economic standing. We all experience life’s challenges and stressors. Although these may look different to each person and have a different effect on them, life hits us all. Anyone can suffer from mental health issues.

In seconds, you get real-time updates on any event anywhere in the world. Information is at our fingertips. As people become more media-savvy and want to be the first to “break the news”, it’s becoming harder to tell what real news is and what is fake. The year is slowly coming to an end, and we’ve put together a list of Top Fake News Stories of 2022/here’s a look at what didn’t happen in 2022. What Is Fake News? Fake news is different from news stories about allegations. Fake news is understood to be news stories that are false, that is, they are entirely lies and are fabricated. They have no verifiable sources, facts or quotes from any spokesperson or authority figure to validate what is being said and shared in the article or social media post. Fake news aims to mislead and deceive the reader. Top Fakes News Stories of 2022 o The Oscar Slap Fake: After the 94th Academy Awards where eventual winner Will Smith got on stage and slapped host Chris Rock for a tasteless joke about Smith’s wife, photos went out claiming the slap was staged and that Rock was wearing a pad on his cheek. Truth: Chris Rock was not wearing a pad. The slap was not staged in any way. Will Smith took offense to the joke about G. I Jane referenced alopecia joke and after sitting down, went on to hurl expletives at Chris Rock, who remained on stage. o Vaccine booster shots increase likelihood of death Fake: A video of a doctor from Tennessee, USA, Dr. Richard Urso told lawmakers in the state that individuals who received covid-19 booster shots were more likely to die from the coronavirus. Truth: The Associated Press reported on this fake news and stated that researchers disputed the vaccine claim with verifiable studies that showed the opposite to be true. o Venezuelan migrants deported from Martha’s Vineyard Fake: PolitiFact reported on a fake news incident where, in a recent Instagram post, it was claimed that 50 migrants who had been flown into Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts had been deported. The post on IG was accompanied by a bus that supposedly carried them off the island. This “humanitarian crisis” post was widely shared on Facebook Truth: A local government or municipality cannot deport any person/s. The truth is alternative plans were made by the state government to provide food and shelter to the migrants on the mainland as the island does not have capacity nor additional resources to adequately accommodate them. o Russia’s War on Ukraine Fake: In Russian media, they refer to their invasion on neighbours Ukraine as a “special military operation”. Russia’s tight control of the media and restricting what is disseminated to its people to be more supportive of the war. Further to this, their fake news focuses on negotiation talks, concessions being made, the role and influence of the USA in the conflict and no reporting on casualties. Truth: What is taking place between Russia and Ukraine is a war with many fatalities. An article in The Conversation highlights how fake and real news is being reported globally, but specifically in Russia and Ukraine. o Florida bans ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ novel in schools Fake: The state of Florida banned several popular titles on its “Banned Book List” from schools, the most noticeable on the list being ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ by Lee Harper. Other titles were said to be, “A Wrinkle in Time,” “The Giver,” and “Of Mice and Men.” Truth: Thousands of people shared the Banned Book List on social media and deliberately misled people into believing this was fact. Florida’s Deputy Press Secretary for the Governor, Jeremy Redfern, clarified this to AP that no such list exists, saying “The state sets guidelines regarding content, and the local school districts are responsible for enforcing them”. Although it had been temporarily removed in the Palm Beach County District, it was returned to the classrooms. What they were not able to control however is the availability of the book in all districts. The danger in fake news is in how quickly it spreads. Like the famous saying, “A lie can travel around the world and back again while the truth is lacing up its boots.” – Mark Twain How to Spot Fake News If there is news, there is bound to be fake news also making the rounds. The burden falls on you as the user to not only spot fake news but take responsibility to not share and spread it further. Verify the source. Inspect the web address you’re viewing the article on. A small spelling error may alert you to the truth of the site and what they are reporting. Double check with other sources. Read other reports from reputable media outlets. Has anyone been quoted in the article? And whom have they quoted? Use a fact-checker site. There are several sites you can use to check if the news story is real. These include Snopes, PolitiFact, Fact Check and BBC Reality Check. Check images. Lots of images used in these articles have been doctored, altered, edited, and manipulated in one way or another. Google’s Reverse Image Search tool allows you to check where various images originate from and whether it’s been altered. Satire or parody. These types of articles and posts often go over people’s heads and they believe them to be true. Satirical posts are not fake news but are just satire. Be informed. The best weapon against misinformation Is information. We need to become digitally savvy and learn what we can about media, news, and information. The tool that is used to spread fake news also employs the tools we can use to fight fake news. That is, digital literacy. And making sure this reaches as far and wide as the fake news spreads.","length":5687,"tokens":1238,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Top Fake News Stories of 2022","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/top-fake-news-stories-of-2022","essay_date":"Oct 6, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Thanks to technology, news is in the palm of your hands 24/7.

Ordinarily, you would arrange a meeting with your manager, express how you feel, and talk about any issues or changes you hope for regarding your job. If all goes well, things may start to change in the workplace. Your responsibilities will shift, and you’ll feel more fulfilled in your role. However, if the Gen Z and millennials way of working is anything to go by, it’s out with this old way of working. And it’s in with the newest trend taking over TikTok and infiltrating the workplace, ‘quiet quitting and acting your wage’. What is Quiet Quitting? Quiet quitting is not quitting your job per se. It involves doing less work or placing firmer boundaries from working outside of one’s working hours. In early 2022, a TikTok user referred to an article that spoke about how many employees have chosen to “take it easy at work” and not quit their jobs. This post quickly blew up and people are talking about it more and more. The understanding behind this phenomenon is that employees are quitting from the idea of doing more than their jobs entail. Instead, employees are choosing to ‘coast’ through their work and simply earn their wage. Acting Your Wage No, not “act your age” as we’ve often heard it said to someone acting younger and in a possibly immature manner. In the professional setting “acting your wage” is another social media trend that grew from quiet quitting. Similarly, it means employees do the bare minimum that they are being paid for. That is, their effort and contribution at work directly reflects their wages. Nothing more; nothing less. What Quiet Quitting and Acting Your Wage Looks Like These trends are taking over the workplaces as frustrations build among workers for a variety of reasons. The general theme of how quiet quitting and acting your wage is unchanging across the board and industries. However, what this looks like to each individual may differ. Here’s some behaviours you can associate with these trends: Not responding to emails, messages on Team and other work platforms outside your set hours Not accepting tasks or taking on additional responsibilities over your set job description Clocking in and out of hour at the allotted time Not being emotionally invested in the company or work No longer “grinding” and pulling in extra hours to get to the next level or corner office Whatever you choose to call it, workers want to be valued, appreciated, and fulfilled at work. As the cost of living is going high, wages that don’t match the inflation, nor the piled-on responsibilities, these trends are not only gaining traction, but they aren’t new either. Why Are People Quiet Quitting? A recent Gallup survey indicated that 18% of employees are actively disengaged at work while more than 50% of those surveyed are just not engaged. The latter are the quiet quitters. People are choosing to act their wage for a variety of reasons. For some, it may be a response to feeling burned out or experiencing high stress levels. A means to reclaim their life outside of the office. Devote time to mental health. Demotivated from high costs of living and low wages A quick mental wellbeing checkup can help you assess how well you’re coping and what you need to do to improve your mental health. The Potential Pitfalls of ‘Quiet Quitting’ and Acting Your Wage Regardless of where the trend originated, it’s important to consider that quiet quitting isn’t all good. There are potential pitfalls that can be associated with quiet quitting and acting your wage. Some of these can include: Quiet quitting can hamper your career trajectory. Oftentimes, it is those employees who work hard and go above and beyond that are noticed and will be promoted. When you choose to act your wage, you’re also choosing to remain static in your career. Limited wage increases or bonuses. When the annual performance review comes around, the employees that will likely be considered and awarded bonuses and a pay rise are those who exceeded expectations. Stagnant career health. We spend a lot of our time at work, giving our time and energy to it. The hazardous effect of quiet quitting means you may lose passion, excitement, and being challenged in your work. In turn, you won’t be noticed or considered by your boss to take on new roles and more challenging tasks. This creates a vicious cycle as it leads to boredom and continuing in doing the bare minimum. Maintaining a work-life balance can be a tricky road to navigate. Everyone is entitled to good mental health and should be allowed to pursue it. The other side of this is that by acting your wage, you set yourself up to remain where you are financially and with shrinking career prospects. What’s the solution? What Quiet Quitters Really Want Employers and organisations need to understand the needs of their staff and not resort to pushing back against those who are quiet quitters. Employees want employers to set defined expectations, and clearly communicate everyone’s roles and responsibilities. Employees want to be fair remuneration that is aligned to their respective tasks and responsibilities. Employers need to recognise and prioritise their employees strive for work-life balance Employers need to create a healthy, comfortable workplace environment and culture that allows individuality and makes room for career growth. Employees want respect, to be heard, autonomy, motivation to give their best at work. They want leaders who lead. More significantly, employees want employers who will follow through with what has been said and set. Is quiet quitting a trend that will last or is it another passing fad? Only time will tell. The truth is that there are all types of people in the workplace and in society. Some of high-functioning overachievers. Others are adequate. And there are those who are happy straddling this line. Each of us has different priorities. Others have the capacity to do more without it affecting their mental health. However, quiet quitters and individuals who choose to act their wage need to be aware that like all things, if you choose this route, you are also choosing the potential consequences this will have on your professional life and financial health. To each his own as the saying goes. And this too is okay.","length":6346,"tokens":1312,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Quiet Quitting & Acting Your Wage","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/quiet-quitting-acting-your-wage","essay_date":"Oct 5, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"What do you do when you’re feeling overworked, underpaid, unheard, and perhaps unappreciated at work?

The cities are much quieter, most tourists have returned home, and the prices are once again more affordable. In the southern hemispheres, winter has passed, and the weather is warming up again. You won’t be lugging around coats and jackets and rubbing hands by the fire. The weather isn’t too hot, so you’ll still be able to enjoy your days without searching for the nearest pool to jump into. Tour Like a Pro Essentials Before you jet off to your destination, there are a few essentials you need to ensure are in place. They may seem boring, and yes, they may be, but are necessary and will save you a lot of trouble if the need calls for them. Travel insurance. This is essential especially if you’re traveling to another country. You don’t want to imagine the worst on your trip, but should the unthinkable happen, your travel insurance policy will cover medical costs, lost luggage, flight delays and more. Coming home with an exorbitant bill will sour any holiday. Book flights in advance. If you can, it’s advised to book your flight tickets in the opposite season of the time you want to travel. So, if you want a winter holiday, book your tickets in summer. And if you want to tour during the summer months, book your tickets in winter for the best prices. Additionally, the best days to book your tickets are on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Medication. Some places are prone to outbreaks and diseases and require you to be fully vaccinated. Consult ahead of departure and make sure you have all the right shots and pills. Don’t forget to check your prescriptions are filled for any prior health issues you may have. Tips To Tour Like A Pro Now you’re ready to go. The boring stuff is out of the way, it’s time for fun. It’s easy to fall into the tourist trap when visiting another country or city. The Eiffel tower in Paris, the Colosseum in Rome. Every city has ‘must-see’ spots like these and it’s not to say don’t go visit them. Because did you really go to Paris if you didn’t take a photo with the Eiffel Tower in the background? These tourist attractions shouldn’t be all you see and do. It’s often been said that the best way to see a city is to experience it like the locals do. Check out a few more tips to get you from beginner to pro. Pack light. Dragging bags of clothes across airports is well…a drag. Pack the essentials and leave room for shopping ahead. Portable charger and power banks. Pack the right adapters for the country you’re visiting and an extra power bank. You don’t want to be stranded without a phone. It’s light and handy and won’t take up space. Learn the local language. No. We don’t expect you to be fluent but learning a few key phrases in the local language will go a long way. The locals will love you for it. Use local transit. In many countries, developing ones too, the local transport system is efficient and goes just about everywhere. You’ll save on taxi fare, see the city the way the locals do, and it’s a great place to put those phrases you learned into practice. Go local. ‘When in Rome, do like the Romans do.’ You didn’t travel all the way to another country to eat at the fast-food joint you left at home, right? Go to the local markets, try their street foods, and dig into their authentic cuisine. These dishes are rich, flavourful and are a great way to get the actual taste of the city. Learn the customs. Some countries are more conservative than others. Many countries frown upon certain practices, innocent as they may be. The last thing you want to do is offend people and be caught in awkward situations. Read a bit about the country’s customs before you land so that you don’t step on anyone’s toes and leave a bad impression. Carry local currency. Calculating conversion rates. Counting notes. How much to tip. Being taken for a ride while bartering with the locals. This can cause a bit of a headache. Always carry local currency. It just makes things easier when you need to pay wherever you are. Now of course, no article can teach you absolutely everything. Some mishaps, mistakes and stumbles are part of the touring experiences, and you’ll need to play it by the ear. Every city has its own language, ways, and an atmosphere that draws people to it. There’s beauty to be discovered and memories to be made. Touring any country is an experience to be enjoyed. If you need help or someone to handle all the logistics on your behalf, get in touch with a travel agent and they’ll sort everything out for you. Remember to be patient. Slow down and take it all in. But, with these in mind, you’re well on your way to be dropped in any city and tour like a pro.","length":6171,"tokens":1411,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Tour Like A Pro","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/tour-like-a-pro","essay_date":"Sep 27, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"After months of working hard, and months of saving money, it’s holiday time.

Language is a vital part of society and connecting with others. Through language, we can share our thoughts, feelings, and ideas with others. Learning a new language is a great way to build relationships and connections in the global world. For the 700 million Europeans that make up the 46 member states of the Council of Europe, it’s encouraged. This European Day of Languages (26 September), the Council reminds us that “linguistic diversity is a tool for achieving greater intercultural understanding and a key element in the rich cultural heritage of our continent.” Fun Facts About European Languages No one knows where language comes from, but it is essential to how society functions. In Europe, Russia is the most spoken language, with 120 million native speakers. German follows at second place with 95 million speakers. It’s also the official language of three countries, (Germany, Austria, and Liechtenstein). It’s also the secondary language to three, Switzerland, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Here are some other interesting language facts to this fascinating construct: The U. N has six official languages, and all documents are published in all these. For 600 years, French was the UK’s official language. More than 7000 languages are spoken globally A new word is created every 98-minutes and there are over 200 languages that are now extinct. Half of the global population is bilingual. The origin of Spain’s Basque language is unknown although it’s spoken by around 700 00 people. It’s not related to any other language. Benefits of Learning a New Language We live in a globalised world. On any given day, we can communicate with individuals from different countries through social media, our travels, or at work. Learning a new language is a great benefit to help bridge the possible communication gaps. Improved career prospects. Employers consider this a valuable skill. You increase your chances of promotion, working at an international office, breaking into new markets and industries, and communicating with customers and clients. Being bilingual, or trilingual, is a great addition to your resume. Makes you a better communicator. When you learn a new language you not only understand a new language, but you also become better at understanding your own. You find yourself using more words and enlarging your vocabulary. This bolsters your creativity as your mind is stretched to the “new”. Improves memory. The more you use your brain, the better it functions. Learning a new language gives your brain a good workout and helps you with recalling facts, figures, and more. Makes you better at multitasking. When you learn a new language, you teach your brain to slip between languages as you translate and practice what you learn. This places extra demand on the brain and this switch slips into other daily functions that need multitasking. Cultural appreciation. Learning a new language means learning about a new culture. This makes you more open, tolerant and a wider outlook on life. You soon realise that your way is not the only way, and you appreciate differences in everyone you meet. And of course, traveling to new destinations and not worrying about the language barrier when you land will be one less stress to think about. You can begin your journey with some of our incredible free courses in French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian. Creative Ways to Practice Speaking a New Language Learning a new language is not easy. There are a myriad of tools at your disposal that you can use to master a new language. Classroom learning is fun but being out and about and is a great way to practise what you’ve learned in other settings. Watch a movie. Put on a film in the language you’re learning – without subtitles (if you want to challenge yourself). Track how well you can follow the movie. And if you hear new and interesting words, look them up and add them to your vocab bundle. Join a club. There are many people also learning the same language as you are. Search out one of these and meet up with the group to practice the new language in an informal setting. Read. Find easy-to-read books in the language you’re learning and assess how much of the book you understand. As you improve, buy more challenging books, magazines, and newspapers. Speak the language. Find someone who speaks the language and ask them to help you practice. There isn’t a better way to learn a language than to speak it. Your confidence will grow as your pronunciation, enunciation and skills improve. Board games/flash cards. These techniques sound simple, and they are. But they are also very helpful and a fun way to learn. Immerse yourself in the culture of the language you’re learning. Language and culture and interlinking. The nuances, expressions, and traditions will enrich your understanding of the language. This also helps you learn the history associated with the words and will prevent you from saying the “wrong” thing. “The European Day of Languages is a celebration of the rich tapestry of languages which make our continent so special.

Not just at home, but at work too. We spend hours at work so it’s only right that you experience happiness as much as possible. Happiness and creating happy work environments make for happier employees. This spills out into other areas of your life and as the saying goes, “happy employee; happy life”. Or something like that. The last week of September celebrates ‘International Week of Happiness at Work’. We’re going to show you why it’s vital and how you can work towards achieving happiness at work. What is International Week of Happiness at Work? International Week of Happiness at Work is a week dedicated to making efforts to make the workplace a happy place. This week is aimed at raising awareness about the importance of being happy at work and how it affects each one of us. Happy employees play a big role in how well a company performs and its output. This is true regardless of whether you work for a boutique company, family business, or large conglomerate. With so much time spent at work, it’s essential to cultivate a happy office environment for yourself and those around you. Why You Should Celebrate International Week of Happiness at Work We live in a culture that drives the “all work and no play” philosophy. We work. Get a side hustle. Pull long hours. And work overtime. It’s admirable and in exchange, we can live comfortable lives. This constant state pushes us mentally and physically – often to our own detriment and unhappiness. Benefits of a Happy Workforce It’s impossible for everyone to be happy all the time. Life and work have its challenges that can get you down at times. But it can be the exception. Happy employees make better employees. Here’s how investing in workplace happiness will give you a positive ROI: Increased productivity Optimistic thoughts and feelings about the organisation. Your employees will go the extra mile to help the company achieve its goals. Positive effects on mental health which results in less nonattendance Engaged staff. This means they’re invested in projects and tasks at work and willing to give time and energy to them – over and above mandatory A happy workforce will also result in a low staff turnover. The commitment to happiness at work has been gaining prominence in recent years. Employers have come to realise its value and consequently, make efforts to foster a happy work environment. Happy employees are great for business. 5 Ways to Celebrate International Week of Happiness at Work Happiness at work is not solely the task of an organisation. It’s a shared responsibility that everyone can contribute to. There are things you can commit to doing daily, weekly, and monthly to help you get to your happy place. We’ve put together a list of things you can do to kickstart happiness: What A Company Can Do to Nourish Happiness at Work Have work events. Employees need to know that they just aren’t work-horses but are seen and valued as individuals too. Organise events to celebrate occasions, birthdays, holidays, engagements, graduations, and so on. This helps foster team morale and workplace engagement, which both contribute to workplace happiness. Provide feedback. When you give your employees constructive feedback, they know what areas to focus on and improve. The feedback and suggestions also make your team feel acknowledged and appreciated and ultimately, a happier workforce. Host after-work drinks or games. This will help strengthen relationships which will in turn allow people to loosen up. If your staff work remotely, let your team knock off 30 minutes early on Friday (provided all work has been completed). Host a webinar. Invite a guest speaker to give an inspirational talk about how to adopt mental and physical wellbeing. Send out a survey. Whether email, a box employee can slip in ideas anonymously or another method. And be open to receiving feedback from staff about ways the organisation can instil practices to ensure a happy workplace culture. What You Can Do to be Happy When you’re happy at work, you’re well on your way to having a healthy work-life balance. Help someone. There’s a proverb that says, “It’s better to give than receive.” Research supports this and shows that when you help others, it can help your self-confidence and boost your level of happiness. Set goals. Focus and prioritise your goals and tasks. This will help reduce your stress levels, which can add to feeling unhappy. Socialise. Have lunch with your workmates away from your desk. Take breaks. Long work hours can take their toll on you, both mentally and physically. It’s important to take regular breaks during the workday. Also take your annual vacation to rest, recharge, and feel rejuvenated. A rested mind, body, and soul lead to happiness. Invest in yourself. Study further if you want to advance at work. Exercise. Practice mindfulness and maintain a healthy and nutritious diet. Happiness is an inside job that cannot be placed in the hands of someone else. Happiness is also not a destination, but a journey. Be intentional about cultivating a happy life – at home and at work. As the late Steve Jobs once said, “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.” That just may be where we can find the seeds of happiness.","length":5403,"tokens":1134,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"International Week of Happiness at Work","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/international-week-of-happiness-at-work","essay_date":"Sep 22, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"We all want to be happy.

Employees need to know that they just aren’t work-horses but are seen and valued as individuals too. Organise events to celebrate occasions, birthdays, holidays, engagements, graduations, and so on. This helps foster team morale and workplace engagement, which both contribute to workplace happiness. Provide feedback. When you give your employees constructive feedback, they know what areas to focus on and improve. The feedback and suggestions also make your team feel acknowledged and appreciated and ultimately, a happier workforce. Host after-work drinks or games. This will help strengthen relationships which will in turn allow people to loosen up. If your staff work remotely, let your team knock off 30 minutes early on Friday (provided all work has been completed) Host a webinar.","content_length":930,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"International Week of Happiness at Work","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/international-week-of-happiness-at-work","essay_date":"Sep 22, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Invite a guest speaker to give an inspirational talk about how to adopt mental and physical wellbeing. Send out a survey. Whether email, a box employee can slip in ideas anonymously or another method. And be open to receiving feedback from staff about ways the organisation can instil practices to ensure a happy workplace culture. What You Can Do to be Happy When you’re happy at work, you’re well on your way to having a healthy work-life balance. Help someone. There’s a proverb that says, “It’s better to give than receive.” Research supports this and shows that when you help others, it can help your self-confidence and boost your level of happiness. Set goals. Focus and prioritise your goals and tasks. This will help reduce your stress levels, which can add to feeling unhappy. Socialise. Have lunch with your workmates away from your desk. Take breaks.","content_length":862,"content_tokens":190,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"International Week of Happiness at Work","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/international-week-of-happiness-at-work","essay_date":"Sep 22, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Long work hours can take their toll on you, both mentally and physically. It’s important to take regular breaks during the workday. Also take your annual vacation to rest, recharge, and feel rejuvenated. A rested mind, body, and soul lead to happiness. Invest in yourself. Study further if you want to advance at work. Exercise. Practice mindfulness and maintain a healthy and nutritious diet. Happiness is an inside job that cannot be placed in the hands of someone else. Happiness is also not a destination, but a journey. Be intentional about cultivating a happy life – at home and at work. As the late Steve Jobs once said, “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.” That just may be where we can find the seeds of happiness.","content_length":880,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Alison Publisher Spotlight: SFA","url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-publisher-spotlight-sfa","date":"Sep 20, 2022","thanks":"","content":"We all dream of achieving financial freedom. This looks different to everyone. The common factor is that we all want to have the financial means to live the life we want. Financial freedom begins with knowledge and understanding how money works and how to make it work for you. This month’s Alison Publisher Spotlight is on SFA (Stewardship Finance Academy). Continue reading and learn how you can use your finances and investing to achieve your financial goals. Please share with our learners a bit about your background. I am from Malaysia but now live in Australia. I received my engineering degree from the University of Queensland. I quit my job as a project engineer after 5 years to learn trading and investing. My passion for teaching and entrepreneurship drove me to establish the Stewardship Finance Academy. This came with the goal of instilling financial confidence in people’s lives. How did you get into the finance and investing space? I’ve always had an interest in stock investing. I read books, watched YouTube videos, and researched stock investments. The defining moment, however, was when I met my mentor, John Yii, who guided me and taught me how to apply the knowledge. Why finance, trading and investing? Everyone wishes to be independent. There is only one way to free yourself from the obligation to work for a living. That is to put your money to work for you. To do so, we must understand how to manage our finances and invest our money. You’ve been a self-publisher with Alison for several years. What do you enjoy most about publishing on this platform?

What are the three main things people need to take note of when it comes to their finances and investing? Invest as early as you can – Over 90% of successful investors start investing early. Many people underestimate the value of time in investment. Focus on application. We live in the digital age, where you can get information for free. But, we must not deceive ourselves and stop at the stage of gathering information. Learning does not produce results; rather, application does. We must put what we have learned into practice.

Who should take SFA courses? In SFA, we specialise in turning beginners to competent investors. People come to us and take our course when they want a complete start-to-finish investment education, a mentor to guide them step by step, and to build self-confidence in deciding which stocks to invest in. Crypto and bitcoin are becoming popular trading activities. What are your thoughts on these as investment strategies? If you want to trade cryptocurrencies for short-term profit, I recommend that you learn technical analysis, conduct fundamental research, understand how cryptocurrencies work, control your emotions, and practice risk and money management. If you want to invest in cryptocurrencies and keep them for a long time, treat them as assets. Diversifying our investments is always a good idea. Cryptocurrencies serve as insurance, a potential hedge against the current fragile monetary system. What common mistakes do people make when it comes to their finances? In our course at Alison “Think Like the Great Investors,” we reveal the 12 most common mistakes people make when it comes to investing. These errors arise from bad habits, resulting in investment losses. Following the herd mentality, looking for a hot tip, and ignoring the risk are a few examples.

SFA plans and structures every course to guide our students from novice to competent investor. We focus on technical and fundamental analysis, and on habit and mindset development.

What is the best approach people should take about their finances? Despite the fact that global economic news is fraught with uncertainty, do not ignore it. Putting our heads in the sand will not save us from doomsday. Throughout history, no wealth has ever left the planet, even during recessions or the Great Depression. Money is transferred. Wealth is moved from one place to another. The reason we should pay attention to macroeconomics is to detect the flow of wealth and position our finances to enjoy it. That is why some people believe that in the midst of every crisis, lies great opportunity. How will SFA courses help enrich the lives of those who take them? Our courses, in conjunction with the mentoring programme, lay a solid foundation in our students. This allows them to invest with confidence. For individuals interested in taking SFA courses, what can they expect to get from it? We update our lessons based on feedback from our students.

What words of advice would you give someone who would like to become a publisher on Alison? With the help of their dedicated publishing manager, Alison provides the best support. There are many publishing criteria that may appear daunting. These are necessary to ensure the quality of the course for the students. What has been your most important lesson or discovery when it comes to online education programmes about money and investing? Check to see if there is a person behind the online programmes with whom you can speak. Organise a face-to-face online meeting if necessary to better observe the instructor. What are the biggest misconceptions about money/finances and investing? Underestimate the impact of inflation to your money and the power of compounding to your investment. When is the best time for people to begin investing or taking charge of their finances? Warren Buffett purchased his first stock when he was 11 years old. You can begin investing as soon as you make the decision to do so. Students learn from their teachers/tutors. Any lessons you have learned from your students? My students have taught me a lot. To name a few: They can achieve anything they set their minds to. They can achieve anything they set their minds to. I should not rule out any possibilities. Pay attention to the students. It is acceptable to say “I don’t know.” Keep it lighthearted and value the relationship What lessons have you learned from your mentor, John Yii? The five most important lessons I’ve learned from my mentors: Take responsibility. Being held accountable prevents me from procrastinating. Learning from one’s mistakes. Learning from my mentor’s mistakes keeps me from making the same ones. This is priceless because it would have cost me money and wasted a lot of time. Inspiration. The trading and investing journey is fraught with ups and downs. When I falter, my mentor encourages me to stay the course. Consult with others before acting.

According to United Nations, one in ten women in Tanzania (aged 15-49) have undergone FGM. Of these, 35 per cent underwent FGM before the age of one. Tanzania is one of the many countries across Africa where FGM is still practiced. Generations pass it down to the next generation. It is also viewed as a rite of passage in the rural areas where this tradition is upheld. These communities associate FGM with dignity and status. In other homes, those holding economic power enforce the practice on those living in the household.

FGM is a brutal practice rooted in cultural and social norms where they remove or cut the external genitalia of the female. They use this custom as a way to control women and in many rural villages and communities, it’s considered a rite of passage – from girl to woman. This harmful practice poses serious mental and physical risks to these women. Hope for Girls & Women Tanzanian activist, Rhobi Samwelly, founded The Hope for Girls and Women (Matumaini kwa Wasichana na Wanawake in Swahili) in 2017. This stemmed from her personal experience of having undergone FGM as a child. The safe haven is driven by Rhobi’s passion and commitment to fight for the rights of all women and girls.

As a global education platform catering for millions of learners, Alison takes its security seriously and upholds the highest standards in safeguarding learners’ data. “Criminals are constantly looking for new ways to target members of the public and while our users have nothing to worry about, it is useful to know some of their tactics and how you can spot a scam,” said a company spokesperson. In one recent instance relating to Alison, the company was informed of a syndicate posing as an Alison HR manager and using the email address [email protected] regarding a Data Entry position. These criminals also contacted an individual by phone. “They informed their target that their résumé and contact information had been found on a job portal like Indeed and set up an interview. Their scam is made more convincing as they plan these interviews using Telegram or Skype. They then tried to get this individual to pay for the training they would receive for the falsely advertised position.” Signs it Could Be Fraud It can be difficult to recognise fraud at work. Take a look at a few ways fraudsters can try to trick you. Phishing Phishing is a criminal tactic where scammers send emails pretending to be from a legitimate company, sometimes a company you may know, or a government institution. They go as far as creating an email address, letterhead, phone number, and website all to appear credible.

You’ve sent out hundreds of resumés but you’ve only received a handful of callbacks from the companies you applied to. You have finally found your dream position – with all the perks. It’s the one you’ve been waiting for, and you know you have one shot to get them to notice you. Each job post receives an estimated 250 applications. 2-3% of these will get invited for the interview. Your make or break lies in one thing – your resumé. Even with the right skills and experience, writing a stand-out résumé is not as easy and straightforward as you’ve discovered. We’re here to empower you with the tips and knowledge you need for your next career move. Don’t fret. Do keep reading. We’ve put together a list of the top 10 resumé do’s and don’ts you need to land you that coveted job or make the switch to something different. What is a Resumé? A resumé is a formal document used by applicants to apply for a job. Here, you give recruiters an account of your educational background, professional qualifications, work experience, skills, and other relevant information your potential employer needs to know. The overall goal of your resumé is to summarise to demonstrate to a hiring manager your potential and why you are the right candidate for the role. What Do Hiring Managers Look For In A Resumé? The truth is there isn’t a blanket answer to this question. This is because it depends on what the hiring manager is looking for – and each position will have different requirements. This is why your resumé needs to be tailored to each new position you’re applying for. More on that below. Don’t lose heart if you think you don’t stand a chance because you don’t know what it is the recruiter or hiring manager wants. There are essential skills, qualifications, and work experience they need to tick off their list to determine if you’re a probable candidate. What you do need to know, however, is that for the most part, recruiters will read a resumé that tells a story of the applicant’s career progression. The right format will indicate where you come from and ultimately how your past positions have led you to the job you’re now applying for. What To Include In Your Resumé? Whether you’re just entering the job market or have worked for years as a professional, the temptation to include everything you’ve done is present. But this is not necessary, and pages and pages of your professional story will give off the wrong impression. The key is to keep it short and include a few key things: Contact details Certificates, awards, honours and professional memberships Educational background Work history Soft, hard, and technical skills Summary statement Key professional accomplishments To help you get noticed, we’ve put together a list of top dos and don’ts of what your resumé should have and doesn’t need: Top 10 Resumé Do’s Do include links to your LinkedIn page, website, or your Alison Public Profile. These give your application a boost. Do make use of a tool like the Alison Resumé Builder to give you a clean, professional, and expert-looking resumé that will make it stand out amongst the rest. K. I. S. S: Keep It Short and Simple. Two pages is the ideal length. Unless you’ve recently graduated from high school, the executive role you’re applying for doesn’t need to include your waitressing gig from 20 years ago. Do use a simple format for your resumé. A Word or PDF file is accepted and easy to access by everyone. Not all companies will have the latest software to open and read other format types. Create a customised resumé for each job application. This ensures your focus is on the specific job skills sought and expresses your interest and excitement about being part of the company. Do quantify your achievements and don’t just provide generic statements like “team player”. Add adds weight to your abilities by making statements like “contributed to my team winning a $10 million project bid”. Do highlight your most relevant work experience. Your resumé should demonstrate how the skills, experience, and accomplishments you’ve had will help you perform in the role you’re applying for. Do list your soft skills. And give examples of where and how you’ve used these skills in your previous roles. Do perform a spell and grammar check using tools like Grammarly or Hemingway. And repeat this exercise one more time before hitting ‘send’. Do include a minimum of two references and ensure you’ve asked them to be your referees. You want them to be prepared for a possible call and have made notes on what to say. So, you’ve looked over your resumé and you’ve done everything right. Read our list of don’ts below to ensure your resumé doesn’t just look good, but great! Top 10 Resumé Don’ts Don’t include personal details like your marital status, or number of children (if any). Don’t hide gaps in your resumé. If you do, they may get the impression there’s something you’re not telling them. Be aware that you may have to explain these in the face-to-face interview. Don’t use coloured text, different font sizes, shading, italics, underlining, boxes, or graphics. If you’re a designer, your portfolio will show off your artistry and skill.

What is a Resumé? A resumé is a formal document used by applicants to apply for a job. Here, you give recruiters an account of your educational background, professional qualifications, work experience, skills, and other relevant information your potential employer needs to know. The overall goal of your resumé is to summarise to demonstrate to a hiring manager your potential and why you are the right candidate for the role. What Do Hiring Managers Look For In A Resumé? The truth is there isn’t a blanket answer to this question. This is because it depends on what the hiring manager is looking for – and each position will have different requirements. This is why your resumé needs to be tailored to each new position you’re applying for.","content_length":887,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Top 10 Resumé Do’s and Don’ts","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/top-10-resume-dos-and-donts","essay_date":"Sep 6, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"More on that below.

What you do need to know, however, is that for the most part, recruiters will read a resumé that tells a story of the applicant’s career progression. The right format will indicate where you come from and ultimately how your past positions have led you to the job you’re now applying for. What To Include In Your Resumé?

The dreaded 45-minutes Q&A that stands between you and moving up the ladder or successfully making that career switch. They are often stressful, can stir up anxiety, and sometimes make you question if you have what it takes to do the job. The truth is you do. And once you’ve learned the winning technique to impress in your interview, the job will be yours. So, whether you have an interview lined up or need to simply brush up on your interview skills, the STAR interview method is the answer you’ve been looking for. What is the STAR Interview Method? The STAR method is an acronym (Situation, Task, Action, Result) used to answer open-ended behavioural questions in interviews. It’s a four-step system that guides you in how you should think and structure the questions posed to you in an interview. The letters stand for: Situation: Fully describe a situation you found yourself in. Or explain the task you were required to accomplish. Task: Explain your specific tasks, responsibilities, and the goals you were working toward in the above-mentioned situation. Action: Outline the different steps and actions you took to resolve the situation. Result: Narrate what the result and outcome of the situation was. This method allows you to answer questions in a structured and compelling way. When you do this well, you put yourself in a positive light and indicate that you can handle pressure – in real-life work situations and in an interview. When Should You Use the STAR Method? Knowing the STAR method is important going into the interview. However, knowing when to use it is more important. Not every question you will be asked will need you to answer using this format. It’s important to be able to identify behavioural questions so that you can give the right answer at the right time. These behavioural questions are easy to spot, and you’ll recognise them when you hear questions leading with the: Have you ever… Can you describe a time when…? Please share an example of a situation when… Tell us about a time when… Give me an example of… We have all come across these kinds of questions in an interview. And if you aren’t fully prepared and caught off guard, a messy response won’t reflect the skills and achievements you showcased in your resume. By using the STAR method, you prepare yourself for the inevitable questions with answers that will impress the interviewer. Sample STAR Interview Question and Answer Okay, so now you have a pretty good idea of the STAR method and will be able to recognise the behavioural question when asked. The question then becomes, how exactly do I answer it? Let’s go through one example together below: Interview Question: Can you give us an example of when you had a tight deadline and had a task to complete? Step 1: Situation Recently, the company decided to redirect its marketing strategy by focusing on email marketing and thus wanted to aggressively increase our email marketing list. Your objective is to set the scene, provide perspective and provide the foundation of the rest of your answer. Step 2: Task In my role as a Communications Officer, my team was tasked with increasing our email subscription list by 30% by the end of the next quarter. Here, my goal was to create email content that would be compelling, interesting, and result in sign-ups and boost subscriptions. Answer this part of the question with some specifics about your role in the scenarios presented and the objectives you had. Step 3: Action I did this by introducing a few strategies to lure our customers and visitors to subscribe. I focused on three key aspects to achieve this. I actioned incentives to email subscriptions, upgraded and repurposed content that we had and worked with the team to host monthly webinars with industry leaders on interesting topics that needed email addresses to sign up and thus be added to our email mailing list. Clearly describe your input, contribution, and the part you played in meeting the objectives. Expand on what steps you took, what measures you sought and more detail on the monthly plan to achieve these action items. Step 4: Result As a result, my strategies helped us increase our email subscriber mailing list by 25% within the four-month period. While we didn’t fully meet the 30% target, the growth showed value and to that end, monthly webinars have been introduced and our subscriber list is increasing. Don’t be afraid of mentioning the challenges, but always be sure to highlight the high notes, successes, and lessons learned from this. This indicates that you take ownership and are willing to learn and improve. STAR Method Interview Tips for Success You do not want to sound robotic, but your answers should flow. This requires some preparation on your part. As Benjamin Franklin said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” Review job description: This highlights the key skills they are looking for and thus allows you to recall stories that will align with these and emphasize your skills. Choose your stories: Have several stories that will be useful to answer the range of possible behavioural questions that will come up. Choose stories that are relevant and meet the STAR targets. Jot down key points: Nerves are a common feeling in interviews. With nerves, comes forgetfulness. Note down key points of each story and make sure they follow the STAR. If you have figures to support your story, even better. Practice: Yes, practice does make perfect. Or it will get you relatively close. This will help you “feel the flow” of the story, speak effectively, feel more natural and boost your confidence. In behaviourial psychology, the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour. By using the STAR interview method in your answers, you demonstrate your ability to handle various situations. And achieve results. When you do this, you show them you have the skills, experience, knowledge, and success record to handle any similar future occurrences.","length":5982,"tokens":1209,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"The STAR Interview Method for Success","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/the-star-interview-method-for-success","essay_date":"Sep 1, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Interviews.

One way to get noticed by recruiters and hiring managers is by presenting a professionally crafted resume. Alison’s new Resume Builder takes this stress away by building you one that will get you noticed. It’s free and simple to use. Your resume is your factsheet. It tells a prospective employer or hiring manager about your skill set and experience level. The second half of the job application process is writing a winning cover letter. Your cover letter should highlight your future and tell the recruiter how you will use your past to enhance and achieve your future goals, but what makes you the ideal candidate for the role and why you believe you’re a great fit for the company. Let’s look at everything you need to know about the good, the bad, and the ugly of cover letters. What Is A Cover Letter? A cover letter is a one-page document that accompanies your resume and tells the recruiter why they should hire you. Your cover letter adds a personal touch to each application and demonstrates all your achievements, experience, qualifications, and most importantly, what makes you the ideal candidate for the position and the best person for the job. The Benefits Of Writing A Cover Letter Depending on the job or company, a cover letter is optional. If this is the case, always opt to include a cover letter. It not only shows your interest in the company but allows you to sell yourself to the hiring manager. Writing a cover letter has advantages that make it worth the time spent to craft one. Gives your application a personal touch Your resume states the facts of your formal qualifications, background and work experience. A cover letter gives the recruiter a better sense of who you are and highlights the exact skills and values you believe will be beneficial to the company you want to work for. Expresses your interest in the company Hundreds of people will be applying for the job. But if optional, only a handful will add their cover letter. By taking time to specially craft one for the company shows you’ve done research on the company and have an interest in more than just the paycheck. Demonstrates your abilities The biggest skill your cover letter will showcase is your attention to detail and impeccable writing skills. Communication is a big part of any job and a valuable transferable skill to have. Your cover letter and how well you write it, further shows your suitability for the job, it kick-starts your relationship with the hiring managers and tells your future employer that you are hardworking and willing to go the extra mile. There are dos and don’ts of cover letters that will either get you to the next stage or send your application to the bin. Here’s everything you need to know about what to do and not do and how to fix it. The Good Keep it brief. Recruiters don’t have time to read an essay or anything more than 400 words. When written well, 200-400 words should be enough to get your message across. Highlight the relevant skills that will help you excel in the role you’re applying for. Be original. A copy-paste job from your favourite website says nothing about you and the effort you took to apply for the position. Research. Do more research about the position you’re applying for and the company’s needs. You can then match your skills, value and experience in the cover letter to these needs. Include job-specific keywords. Proofread. A perfect cover letter is one without silly mistakes, typos, structural and grammar errors. It speaks to attention to detail – a quality every employer is looking for. The Bad You very rarely get a second chance to make a good first impression. More so when your dream job is on the line. These listed examples are cover letter no-nos. Sending one cover letter to all positions you are applying for. Recruiters have a sixth sense for the ‘one-size-fits-all’ letter. A cover letter longer than one page. Not including your unique selling points. Simply saying you are applying for the position is not enough. So are the 101 other applications they’re receiving. Concluding your letter with a passive ending. Don’t just sign off your letter but add something like, “I will follow up in a few days to find out if you have additional questions. Until then, you can find out more about me on my Alison profile and contact me on 555 555-5555 for any questions. The Ugly An error-laden cover letter. Proofread what you’ve written a few times. You can also ask a friend or family member to give you feedback. No research on the position and company. Your cover letter should show that you’ve read up on the company, its values, the culture, and the qualities, skills and requirements they’re looking for in a candidate. Very casual tone – using text lingo is a big RED flag. Using the wrong company information in the letter or addressing Mr Jones as “Mrs Davids”. Repeating the content of your resume. Talking only about you, you and you. It’s good to let them know who you are. It’s terrible if your entire letter speaks only about you and nothing about the company. Underselling yourself. Drawing attention to your lack of skills or knowledge is a sure-fire way to not get hired. Focus on what you have and what your future employer will be impressed by. Always double check your letter before pressing ‘send’. You may spot something in that final check that you missed before. Remember, your resume looks at your past. Your cover letter should highlight your future and tell the recruiter how you will use your past to enhance and achieve your future goals. By applying these to your cover letter, you’ll be well on your way to begin preparing for your interview. If your resume is your elevator pitch, then your cover letter is what will take you to the top floor. Add icing on the “cake” by including your Alison Public Profile to your application and send it along. Your dream job awaits.","length":5927,"tokens":1267,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly of Cover Letters","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-cover-letters","essay_date":"Aug 30, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Applying for jobs can be an arduous process.

Homeschooling is an attractive education option, and many choose it for various reasons. One of these reasons are the subjects available for children that traditional school systems don’t always offer. Some of these are the humanities subjects. Read on for our review on the arts of homeschooling. We’ll also discuss the subjects your children can do to nurture these talents. The Homeschool Curriculum The beauty of homeschooling is that you or your children and students are no longer bound by the class structure and format regular schooling follows or prescribes. Homeschooling as an educational alternative is also seeing a range of curricula options and resources to suit different learning philosophies, study approaches, and the time a teacher can give to daily lessons and instructions. You can follow the standard discipline. But you can also create room to encourage the child’s talents and interests. It also allows the learner to discover and hone their passions. Which in turn gives the student a personal touch to their learning experience. If you have more than one child homeschooling, they can take the same arts subjects. The difference will lie in the age-specific assignments they need to complete. Understanding the Arts of Homeschooling The arts is a field with many facets. As a parent, like the rest of us, you may enjoy the various creative expressions involved in the arts. Teaching the subjects, on the other hand, needs more than a textbook. You need resources, supplies and a dollop or two of creativity to make it exciting, and interesting. Studying the arts is a place where talent and skill are developed. The possible cost and challenge may seem impossible at first but with the right resources available and with a little help from Alison, it can be done. Art Styles for Homeschool The credits of any film, song, television show and the depth of a piece of visual art tell you that there are many styles and components to “art”. It’s a broad field which cannot be easily categorised. You wouldn’t want to either considering how much art and creativity exists. To make it easier to understand, the arts have been grouped into different styles. Each style is unique and explores and challenges different thinking, senses, and artistic pursuits. o Visual Arts The visual arts is a medium that encompasses visual perception. It’s the things you can see like sculpting, drawing, photography, filmmaking, crafting, ceramics, and architecture to name a few. These arts can further be categorised in decorative, commercial, and the fine arts. Think museums and the different types of museums you can visit. It’s a fun, interactive, “get your hands dirty” subject that can be enjoyed by children of all ages at home. DIY art projects, here we come. o Performing Arts As the name suggests, this is art which is performed in front of an audience and includes music, dance, and drama. Part of these arts are the musical instruments, hair, makeup, costume, and stage props that accompany a performance. Traditionally, this is taught by a certified instructor in a class setup where the voice, body, and facial expressions also have a strong presence on the stage. o Applied Arts “Applied arts” refers to the broad spectrum of art that includes the application of aesthetics and design in finding techniques and solutions for everyday practical things. Functionality comes into play in these arts, and this can be found in interior, fashion, and graphic design. Alison’s Art Courses for Home-Schooling The truth is, not everyone is creatively inclined. Even if this is true for you, it doesn’t mean your child or student will have to resort to basic theory when studying the arts at home. Alison’s Homeschool Hub has a plethora of courses you take to learn new skills, techniques, and facets of music, visual arts, drama, and design. o Visual Arts Alison’s visual arts courses appeal to learners who may have an interest in the arts but may feel they aren’t “creative”. Lovers of the Japanese comic book style anime, can learn How to Draw, Drawing Anime Characters – The Head, Face & Eyes, or go deeper with the Drawing Anime Characters – Full Features and Emotions course. Our Arts and Design Hub has plenty of other courses you can explore. o Music Pop. Classical. Modern. Folk or country. Music theory or even learning how to play an instrument. Have an ear for music but need help with the pitch and chords? Or you don’t have the voice but consider yourself a beat master and want to make music? our wide selection of music-related courses will have you singing in no time. o Drama If the stage is where you shine and you see yourself starring in a Broadway play or making people laugh with your comedic skills, we’ve got you covered. Begin your performing arts on the first page by learning the essentials of screenwriting and follow this up with courses from Emma Paunil. If, however, you consider yourself the star of the small or big screen, our Guide to Start Acting in Film & TV will get you once step closer. o Design And finally, design. This applied art discipline is for home-schoolers who want to learn how to channel their creativity with a purpose. Our design courses are for the solution-driven creatives who can walk into a room or step outside and know how to design and turn it into an amazing space. Fashion designers and graphic designers will flourish with our courses. The arts are rich and broad. We reach for them in our downtime and depend on them to make us laugh, feel good, entertain, inform, and enrich our lives. The arts are a vital aspect of any society and therefore need just as much time, effort, energy, and dedication to make sure we all enjoy them for decades to come. This starts with investing in and utilising the resources during the home-school years and beyond.","length":5991,"tokens":1258,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"The Arts of Homeschooling","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/the-arts-of-homeschooling","essay_date":"Aug 29, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"One of the biggest decisions you’ll make as a parent is deciding to homeschool your children instead of sending them to a private or a traditional public school.

As a teacher, you carry the responsibility of sharing and shaping the minds of your students. The relationship between a student and their teacher sets the tone for improved engagement, achievement, and draws out their desire to learn. What better way to explore this relationship than by speaking to a member of this noble profession. This month, our Alison Publisher Spotlight is on accomplished teacher and author, Leigh Faulkner. Please share with our learners a bit about your background. I started my teaching career in my home province of Nova Scotia, Canada, when I was eighteen years old. Three years later I became a school principal. After twenty-seven years in public schools, I began university teaching – first in the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, Canada, then as a volunteer English curriculum developer in the teachers college of Danang University, in Danang, Vietnam, and finally, until retirement, as a tenured professor in Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, in Beppu, Kyushu, Japan. Since my official retirement, I’ve developed and facilitated workplace education programs, carried out organizational training needs assessments, and tutored public school, university, and apprenticeship students. For the last few years, I’ve been developing online courses, like those here on Alison. In terms of my own education, I have a BA, a BEd, an MA, and an EdD, along with workplace education certification. How did you get into teaching, education, and training? As a child I was fascinated with airplanes. Career wise, I hoped to go into the air force and become a pilot. However, circumstances changed that because I was colourblind – and colourblind people do not fly planes, at least in the Canadian military. So, I made a last minute decision to attend the Normal College one-year program. In retrospect, I think it was a good career choice. You’ve been a self-publisher with Alison for several years. What do you enjoy most about publishing on this platform? The business model is student-friendly. Students around the world who might not be able to pay for courses have access to a vast array of courses here on Alison. A second powerful recommendation for Alison, in my opinion, is the attention to quality. The Publishing Account Manager and the review team provide excellent guidance and support during the course development process. What lessons or takeaways have you learned as a self-publisher on Alison? Well, I always thought that I gave careful attention to each stage of the course development process, however, I’ve gained a new appreciation of the need to give extra careful attention to detail while creating courses. A simple example is the need to check carefully that audio and video are perfectly synced. I guess another takeaway is “Don’t make assumptions!” How has being a self-publisher on Alison changed or impacted your life? I’ve been a life-long teacher, and being a self-publisher on Alison has allowed me to continue teaching after my classroom career came to an end. I appreciate that. How has the adjustment from face-to-face to remote video tutoring been for you? I miss the face-to-face interaction, but, overall, the transition to remote video tutoring has been relatively easy. I enjoy technology, so crafting courses has been satisfying. In terms of one-to-one tutoring, I found that the wide range of online resources that the student and I could access enriched the tutoring experience. How should learners approach remote video tutoring and learning? That’s a difficult question, since people have developed a range of successful learning skills and may have to adjust them when taking online courses. Learning takes effort and time, so I think that learners need to be patient. Learners need to consciously make connections between what they are learning and what they already know; in this way, they provide a foundation for the new learning. Another thing to keep in mind is that no course contains everything there is to know about a topic, so the learner should be ready to consult other sources for additional information or different perspectives. Who should take your courses? Some of my courses are designed for students in high school or university. “Mastering the Academic Desk Research Paper” and “Deep Reading” are examples. “Facilitating Adult Learning Groups,” on the other hand, is for people, perhaps in business or in adult education, who want to understand more about the principles and processes of adult group facilitation, especially when the groups are noticeably diverse. I would say that the course “Foundations of Effective Oral Communication” is for everyone from teen to adult. The course “Appreciating Metaphor” is intended for anyone who wants to explore the English language in a way and to a depth that perhaps they’ve never undertaken before. Why should people be invested in continuing/furthering their studies? I have a tagline on my personal website. It says, “Education changes everything.” I believe that’s true. I think that people can keep learning and growing and building a better future for themselves. I think there is an element of the unexpected, too, since we never know when a simple experience we’ve had or something we’ve learned will become important in defining the next life choice or career choice. What’s the importance of studying your courses for those who aren’t pursuing careers in academia? I like to think that all my courses are for those who are “pursuing a career in life.” That may sound flippant, but I don’t mean it to be. I have a firm belief that everything we learn, no matter how seemingly insignificant, has a place in helping to determine who we are and what our capacities are and what we can accomplish in life. What feedback have you received from learners about your course? I would welcome feedback, but I am still waiting! For individuals interested in taking one of your courses, what can they expect to get from it? In the course “Mastering the Academic Desk Research Paper,” for example, I map out in detail the processes involved, from assignment analysis, through development of a research question or thesis statement, information gathering and analysis, paper organization, the qualities of effective writing, editing and revision, and, finally, submission. What words of advice would you give someone who would like to become a publisher on Alison? I would say: Take stock of what you know well and what you have an interest in. Be prepared to carry out research to support—or correct—your ideas and to expand on them. Pay close attention to how you organize the information; there needs to be logic to the course development. Welcome feedback; your PAM and review team are tremendous supporters. How does workplace training assessment affect employees and teams? As a workplace educator, I’ve performed many organizational needs assessments (ONAs). These are designed to identify what skills workers have and where the skills gaps are. Central to the process is the awareness that effective teams are crucial to the success of an organization. As a result, whenever I write an ONA report, I always frame it in terms of individual and team development. By the way, most of the courses I’ve recommended in the ONA reports are forty-hour courses spread over several weeks, with adequate time for participants to absorb the ideas and apply them. What has been your most important lesson or discovery when it comes to education programmes? There are so many, but one I haven’t mentioned yet is the value I place on the knowledge and skills that participants bring to the programs. I think that participants, themselves, especially within a cooperative or collaborative structure, are the single most important resource for program success. Students learn from their teachers/tutors. Any lessons you have learned from your students? There have been many lessons, and one of the most important is that I don’t know everything. Maybe when I started teaching, I thought that the teacher’s role was to be the source and dispenser of all knowledge, but not anymore. I think I learn something from each and every learner I work with. I’ve especially learned that humility isn’t a bad quality for an educator. What else can Alison and its learners look forward to from you in the coming year to two? Currently, I’m working on a course on academic learning resources. Among other things, I taught study skills at university. I came to the conclusion that many of the resources that can enrich the academic experience go underutilized. On the reverse side, I noted that students who took advantage of learning resources were more well-rounded learners. In other words, the additional effort needed to use available learning resources paid rich dividends. I want to capture this in the course. Any last words, advice, or wisdom you’d like to share with our learners? Be hungry! Learn everything you can. Enjoy the learning journey! And, above all, value yourself as a learner! Our Alison Publisher Spotlight on Leigh Faulkner shows us that teachers too are lifelong learners. To this we say, “Never stop learning, because life never stops teaching.”","length":9311,"tokens":1931,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Alison Publisher Spotlight: Leigh Faulkner","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-publisher-spotlight-leigh-faulkner","essay_date":"Aug 26, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"As a learner, being in the classroom opens your world up to a world of knowledge, new ideas, information, and more.

Welcome feedback; your PAM and review team are tremendous supporters.","content_length":996,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Publisher Spotlight: Leigh Faulkner","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-publisher-spotlight-leigh-faulkner","essay_date":"Aug 26, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"How does workplace training assessment affect employees and teams? As a workplace educator, I’ve performed many organizational needs assessments (ONAs) These are designed to identify what skills workers have and where the skills gaps are. Central to the process is the awareness that effective teams are crucial to the success of an organization. As a result, whenever I write an ONA report, I always frame it in terms of individual and team development. By the way, most of the courses I’ve recommended in the ONA reports are forty-hour courses spread over several weeks, with adequate time for participants to absorb the ideas and apply them. What has been your most important lesson or discovery when it comes to education programmes? There are so many, but one I haven’t mentioned yet is the value I place on the knowledge and skills that participants bring to the programs. I think that participants, themselves, especially within a cooperative or collaborative structure, are the single most important resource for program success.","content_length":1037,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Publisher Spotlight: Leigh Faulkner","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-publisher-spotlight-leigh-faulkner","essay_date":"Aug 26, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Students learn from their teachers/tutors. Any lessons you have learned from your students? There have been many lessons, and one of the most important is that I don’t know everything. Maybe when I started teaching, I thought that the teacher’s role was to be the source and dispenser of all knowledge, but not anymore. I think I learn something from each and every learner I work with. I’ve especially learned that humility isn’t a bad quality for an educator. What else can Alison and its learners look forward to from you in the coming year to two? Currently, I’m working on a course on academic learning resources. Among other things, I taught study skills at university. I came to the conclusion that many of the resources that can enrich the academic experience go underutilized. On the reverse side, I noted that students who took advantage of learning resources were more well-rounded learners.","content_length":902,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Publisher Spotlight: Leigh Faulkner","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-publisher-spotlight-leigh-faulkner","essay_date":"Aug 26, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"In other words, the additional effort needed to use available learning resources paid rich dividends.

Two elements that when put together in their raw state, make up photography. We all know how to take a photo, but not many of us would call ourselves photographers. Photographs give us something to look back on. Photography is an art. The photographer is an artist who in one click can elicit feelings, memories, inspire creativity, imagine a different reality, take you to a place you’ve never been, leave you in awe of the majesty of nature and wildlife. World Photography Day, (World Photo Day) is a day that captures the science, art, craft, and history of photography. Here, we’re taking a step away from the lens, to look at how this art was created and has evolved into the billion-dollar industry it is today. The History of Photography Between the 13th and 14th centuries, before the camera and the lens, there was ‘camera obscura’ – the object used to process images. A small hole was cut into one side of a dark, closed space. Light would come through the hole and create an image on the surface where it connects and then flipped upside down. The invention of photography, like many things, was the result of tinkering with chemicals, experiments, and trials. The first official photograph was taken by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826 and needed eight hours of sun exposure to be processed. In 1839, the world was introduced to the Daguerreotype process. This process reduced exposure time to mere seconds and allowed individuals to create detailed images on copper sheets which were then coated with silver. Decades later George Eastman refined the process and in 1888 he developed the now world-famous Kodak camera. The rest, as they say, is history. “The discovery I have made, and which I call Heliography, consists in reproducing spontaneously, by the action of light, with gradations of tints from black to white, the images received in the camera obscura.” – Joseph Nicéphore Niépce What is Photography? Photography is an art. It’s a process of capturing and producing images using a camera by recording light. This can be achieved by using light-sensitive film or electronically with digital photography. It’s a medium that requires skill, technique, talent, and artistry to capture key moments in time. Moments that when looked back on will tell you a story and give you an account of that period. “The whole point of taking pictures is so that you don’t have to explain things in words”. – Elliott Erwitt Types of Photography When it comes to the art world, very few people can do it all. True to form, photography is an art where photographers generally specialise and focus on a certain style. In the same way that not all artists paint, draw and sculpt, each photography genre requires its own skill set. This is not to say you can’t learn and become adept at another style, but it will take time, lessons, and mastering techniques vital to your success in that type. Let’s look at a few below of these types below: Fashion photography Portrait Architecture Wedding and event Fine art Street style Sport photography Photojournalism Editorial Wildlife Travel Lifestyle Nature/landscape The beauty of photography is you could find that one photo could straddle between two types. Or one may not fully meet the criteria for a specific genre. You could be passionate and skilled in more than one. The idea is not to limit or box the photographer in one thing, but simply give you an idea of the variety the medium has and you can enjoy. What Makes a Good Photograph? If you’re taking photos, or are the subject of the photograph, one thing you both want is for the picture to “wow”. You don’t need to be an award-winning professional or model to achieve this. Personal photos can be pieces of art or have the essentials: focus, sharpness, and good lighting. If you’re using a handheld camera, you need to make sure these settings are balanced to give you that perfect shot: Shutter speed: the speed at which your camera sensor is exposed to the outside/closes. The faster the speed it’s set to, the greater chance to take a clear action shot. Aperture: your camera’s “pupil” – the opening in the lens where the light comes through the camera. ISO: the camera setting that will lighten or darken a photograph. If the environment you’re shooting in is dark, you need to have a higher ISO. This is arguably the most crucial of the three settings because it can affect the exposure and ultimately what your photograph will look like. Today, our phones can be of even better quality than some cameras and meet most of your basic needs. They’re light to carry, easy to use, and if you’re big on social media and sharing your pics, provide you with seamless integration into many apps. Need to edit your photos? There are handy apps for that as well. The quality is so good people won’t know the difference. How to Celebrate World Photography Day The advances in technology have put the camera in people’s hands and it’s quickly become a hobby of many. Photography isn’t exclusive to the rich who have their portraits taken annually, nor is it too expensive a hobby to take up. So, if you’re a beginner, your friend’s personal photographer, or a professional, you can celebrate today: Smile. Say cheese. Strike a pose. Learn more about the history and science of photography Share your favourite photograph – shot by you or your favourite photograph Enrol for a beginner, intermediate, or advanced digital photography course If you’re a pro, teach aspiring photographer tips, tools, and tricks of the trade Or reminisce with friends and family by looking at old photos and share laughs, cries, and stories about the Kodak moment. There are many days celebrating and observing key moments in time. It’s not every day that each of us can fully participate in and connect with on a personal level. And that’s the beauty of photography, it contains the humanity of the moment.","length":5902,"tokens":1301,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"World Photography Day – 19 August","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/world-photography-day-19-august","essay_date":"Aug 19, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Light and time.

The History of Photography Between the 13th and 14th centuries, before the camera and the lens, there was ‘camera obscura’ – the object used to process images.","content_length":893,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"World Photography Day – 19 August","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/world-photography-day-19-august","essay_date":"Aug 19, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"A small hole was cut into one side of a dark, closed space. Light would come through the hole and create an image on the surface where it connects and then flipped upside down. The invention of photography, like many things, was the result of tinkering with chemicals, experiments, and trials. The first official photograph was taken by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826 and needed eight hours of sun exposure to be processed. In 1839, the world was introduced to the Daguerreotype process. This process reduced exposure time to mere seconds and allowed individuals to create detailed images on copper sheets which were then coated with silver. Decades later George Eastman refined the process and in 1888 he developed the now world-famous Kodak camera. The rest, as they say, is history.","content_length":786,"content_tokens":165,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"World Photography Day – 19 August","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/world-photography-day-19-august","essay_date":"Aug 19, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"“The discovery I have made, and which I call Heliography, consists in reproducing spontaneously, by the action of light, with gradations of tints from black to white, the images received in the camera obscura.” – Joseph Nicéphore Niépce What is Photography? Photography is an art. It’s a process of capturing and producing images using a camera by recording light. This can be achieved by using light-sensitive film or electronically with digital photography. It’s a medium that requires skill, technique, talent, and artistry to capture key moments in time. Moments that when looked back on will tell you a story and give you an account of that period. “The whole point of taking pictures is so that you don’t have to explain things in words” – Elliott Erwitt Types of Photography When it comes to the art world, very few people can do it all.","content_length":844,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"World Photography Day – 19 August","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/world-photography-day-19-august","essay_date":"Aug 19, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"True to form, photography is an art where photographers generally specialise and focus on a certain style. In the same way that not all artists paint, draw and sculpt, each photography genre requires its own skill set. This is not to say you can’t learn and become adept at another style, but it will take time, lessons, and mastering techniques vital to your success in that type. Let’s look at a few below of these types below: Fashion photography Portrait Architecture Wedding and event Fine art Street style Sport photography Photojournalism Editorial Wildlife Travel Lifestyle Nature/landscape The beauty of photography is you could find that one photo could straddle between two types. Or one may not fully meet the criteria for a specific genre. You could be passionate and skilled in more than one. The idea is not to limit or box the photographer in one thing, but simply give you an idea of the variety the medium has and you can enjoy.","content_length":946,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"World Photography Day – 19 August","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/world-photography-day-19-august","essay_date":"Aug 19, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"What Makes a Good Photograph? If you’re taking photos, or are the subject of the photograph, one thing you both want is for the picture to “wow” You don’t need to be an award-winning professional or model to achieve this. Personal photos can be pieces of art or have the essentials: focus, sharpness, and good lighting. If you’re using a handheld camera, you need to make sure these settings are balanced to give you that perfect shot: Shutter speed: the speed at which your camera sensor is exposed to the outside/closes. The faster the speed it’s set to, the greater chance to take a clear action shot. Aperture: your camera’s “pupil” – the opening in the lens where the light comes through the camera. ISO: the camera setting that will lighten or darken a photograph.","content_length":770,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"World Photography Day – 19 August","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/world-photography-day-19-august","essay_date":"Aug 19, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"If the environment you’re shooting in is dark, you need to have a higher ISO.

They’re light to carry, easy to use, and if you’re big on social media and sharing your pics, provide you with seamless integration into many apps. Need to edit your photos? There are handy apps for that as well. The quality is so good people won’t know the difference.

This simply means they are learning another language. Benjamin Batarseh said it best: “The hardest foreign language you will ever learn is your first one.” Going from beginner to intermediate, advanced and ultimately proficient takes time, effort, and patience. The rewards, however, are priceless. Today, we’re going to discuss the English Vertical: the next steps and benefits. Why is Learning English Important? Many people don’t know or realise the value of learning English. It seems distant, impossible or “not for me.” Learning, especially learning English, is for everyone. It’s a global language spoken in over 70 different countries; and is the standard language used in numerous fields and industries. How the English Vertical Helps You Let’s say, for instance, you enjoy film and television, but you want to do more than read the subtitles. Or you want to travel to an English-speaking country and don’t want to rely solely on your translator app. Maybe you have your eye on a position you want to apply for or a global company you want to join. All of these goals benefit from increased English skills, but you feel limited in your language skill and struggle with achieving your dream. The Alison English Vertical is a set of courses that, when followed to completion, will take you from beginner level to advanced. They will help you grow your skills and achieve your goals, regardless of your initial speaking, reading, and understanding level. Whatever your reason and need for learning English, Alison’s English Vertical has a course for your level. Take the free English test and get recommended courses based on your results. Benefits of Enrolling in English Vertical Courses The English Vertical courses don’t just focus on one element of the language. They cover the four essential language skills (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) to help you improve in all aspects. The courses are built around the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and focus on level-specific grammar and vocabulary to help you get a deeper understanding of the language. Building relationships Years ago, our long-distance friendships and relationships were limited. Today, social networks and digital advances mean that we can develop close relationships with people anywhere in the world. The Internet has made communication easy and accessible. The more proficient you become through English Vertical courses, the larger your digital community becomes. As your skills grow, you can participate in various forums, debates, discussions and read many websites without much difficulty. Lifetime of learning If you aren’t learning, you aren’t growing. Learning opens your mind to new things, perspectives, thoughts, and the world. When you enrolled for your first course in the English Vertical, you wanted to learn something new. Continuing the path that you’ve started stretches your cognitive abilities. These abilities go further than English and contribute to your mental flexibility and capacity to focus on multiple things. Boosts confidence In the beginner course, you may not feel this way because you’re self-conscious about your grammar, pronunciation, and sentence structures. However, as you complete one level and progress to the next, you recognise new words and phrases; and you can express yourself better. You build your confidence at each level based on the foundation you’ve established. Soon you can have longer conversations and will feel comfortable talking to native speakers. Learning a new culture Language plays a key role in understanding a different culture, it gives you a peek into their history. You learn the meaning behind idioms (a type of verbal expression) and can use common phrases comfortably. You also understand movies, music, and other forms of media. All of this allows you to interact better with others when traveling or working on a global team. Career success On a professional level, businesses that operate globally rely on English as their primary language. When you become proficient in the English language, your career opens up to new opportunities and possibilities. Good English will set you apart from your colleagues who may not be as skilled in the language. And even if English isn’t a requirement for your current position, it’s a valuable skill to add to your resume for doors that will open in the future. The English Vertical is not limited to working professionals. It can help students, too. You can attend prestigious international schools and universities or study abroad and achieve your academic goals.

That is, 1.2 billion people make up the 15-24 age group. Franklin D. Roosevelt said, “We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future”. If these are anything to go by, we need to build a society that will be sustainable and livable for the youth of tomorrow. International Youth Day is celebrated annually on 12 August. Read to learn more about the challenges facing the youth and how together with the older generation we overcome these challenges and live under an intergenerational society that’s beneficial for all. What Is International Youth Day? International Youth Day is a day celebrated annually on 12 August. On this day, the key challenges facing the youth are highlighted to broader international communities. This year’s theme is Intergenerational Solidarity: Creating a World for All Ages. Its goal is to highlight that change is needed to address the disconnect between generations and ensure that no age group should be left behind as the world moves forward. The issue of ageism, the stereotypes, discrimination, and prejudices that affect how we think, act, and feel about one another based on one’s age, comes to the fore. It affects everyone. Older people are viewed as rigid, boring, old-fashioned, stubborn, and traditional. The youth, conversely, are viewed as irresponsible, lost, wayward, with no work ethic, and too modern. Both assumptions are damaging and limiting as they influence the needs, opportunities, skills, and abilities that each has and can contribute to the growth of the wider society. And leverage the knowledge that can be used to bridge the divide. Who Are The Youth? There is no one universal definition for the youth age group, however, “youth” is defined and understood as the time between your childhood and adulthood. The youth are those between the ages of 15-24, although this varies in some countries. It’s the period of transition between the two periods and this period is characterised by ‘freshness’, ‘energy’, ‘vitality’, and ‘vigour’ to name a few. It’s also a time where the generation is are about: being spontaneous and exploring, becoming self-aware, are thirsty for knowledge, live inspired, and maximising on the potentials of technology and the digital space. The youth are the backbone of their country and are the builders of tomorrow, with the ability to drive and influence culture, societies, developments, and their country’s policies. The youth are the future. What Are The Biggest Challenges Facing The Youth? When you think of the youth, you also think of progress and change. Unfortunately, these truths are met with challenges. Global issues and crises, and local issues all influence the future and can hamper this growth. Unemployment High and increasing costs of living Gender and social inequalities Debt and shifting economies Poverty Time and stress management Political unrest Mental health issues Social media These challenges can be met when the youth work together with the older generation to find sustainable solutions that will create a better world. 9 Strategies to Bridge The Gap Between Young and Old At a glance, these challenges may seem insurmountable for the youth to shoulder. Both young and old need to work together to overcome these. However, this has often been a challenge in itself – bridging those gaps between generations to find solutions. To do this successfully, young, and old need to find common ground, draw knowledge, wisdom from the old, and innovation from the youth to overcome the obstacles. A few simple ways to marry the two can be to: Create generational awareness Personalise approaches between young and old Utiliise different communication techniques Be open to learning and listening Ask questions. Be teachable and open to learning. Don’t assume you’re always right Understand and respect differences and values Develop intergenerational relationships Create intergenerational-friendly environments Avoid using stereotypes The world is not just for the youth, but for all generations living in it. When there is intergenerational solidarity, we can all work together to find solutions, there’s no mountain that will be too high to climb, no one will feel left out in creating a better world and all will be able to benefit from all the world has to offer. Benefits of Intergenerational Solidarity When we speak about an intergenerational society, we mean the level of support and close relationship that exists between the different generations. Solidarity focuses on how these different generations can relate to, depend on, and understand one another. The work being done by the older generation is the inheritance the youth will be rewarded with. Similarly, whatever the youth of today are sowing, our children and grandchildren will reap. This underlies the value of balancing the needs of the young and old – strengthening that solidarity between the generations. Less ageism Transfer of knowledge – learning and sharing skills Stronger communities Easing financial burdens Inclusion in nation-building policies Both generations have a sense of worth and purpose Reduced feelings of social isolation which can affect mental health The advantage of intergenerational solidarity enriches all members of each age group. Even with International Youth Day being celebrated, fostering this means older generations won’t be left out and that they can (and should) contribute to young people. For the youth, this will empower them to have a say in the world they stand to inherit. It’s International Youth Day but it’s a day that encourages the older generation to lead, support and guide the youth. It’s also a day where the youth should recognise the necessity to nurture, draw from the wells of the older generation and use that as our inheritance to build on the days to come. If we can commit to working through the challenges, the youth will build on the successes of the former. With the energy of the youth and the wisdom of the old, we can achieve more.","length":6114,"tokens":1234,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"International Youth Day: 12 August","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/international-youth-day-12-august","essay_date":"Aug 12, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"According to the United Nations, the youth accounts for 16% of the global population.

The issue of ageism, the stereotypes, discrimination, and prejudices that affect how we think, act, and feel about one another based on one’s age, comes to the fore. It affects everyone. Older people are viewed as rigid, boring, old-fashioned, stubborn, and traditional. The youth, conversely, are viewed as irresponsible, lost, wayward, with no work ethic, and too modern. Both assumptions are damaging and limiting as they influence the needs, opportunities, skills, and abilities that each has and can contribute to the growth of the wider society. And leverage the knowledge that can be used to bridge the divide. Who Are The Youth? There is no one universal definition for the youth age group, however, “youth” is defined and understood as the time between your childhood and adulthood.","content_length":963,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"International Youth Day: 12 August","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/international-youth-day-12-august","essay_date":"Aug 12, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"The youth are those between the ages of 15-24, although this varies in some countries.

It’s also a time where the generation is are about: being spontaneous and exploring, becoming self-aware, are thirsty for knowledge, live inspired, and maximising on the potentials of technology and the digital space. The youth are the backbone of their country and are the builders of tomorrow, with the ability to drive and influence culture, societies, developments, and their country’s policies.

Both young and old need to work together to overcome these. However, this has often been a challenge in itself – bridging those gaps between generations to find solutions. To do this successfully, young, and old need to find common ground, draw knowledge, wisdom from the old, and innovation from the youth to overcome the obstacles.","content_length":903,"content_tokens":164,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"International Youth Day: 12 August","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/international-youth-day-12-august","essay_date":"Aug 12, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"A few simple ways to marry the two can be to: Create generational awareness Personalise approaches between young and old Utiliise different communication techniques Be open to learning and listening Ask questions.

When there is intergenerational solidarity, we can all work together to find solutions, there’s no mountain that will be too high to climb, no one will feel left out in creating a better world and all will be able to benefit from all the world has to offer.

The work being done by the older generation is the inheritance the youth will be rewarded with. Similarly, whatever the youth of today are sowing, our children and grandchildren will reap. This underlies the value of balancing the needs of the young and old – strengthening that solidarity between the generations. Less ageism Transfer of knowledge – learning and sharing skills Stronger communities Easing financial burdens Inclusion in nation-building policies Both generations have a sense of worth and purpose Reduced feelings of social isolation which can affect mental health The advantage of intergenerational solidarity enriches all members of each age group. Even with International Youth Day being celebrated, fostering this means older generations won’t be left out and that they can (and should) contribute to young people. For the youth, this will empower them to have a say in the world they stand to inherit.","content_length":1031,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"International Youth Day: 12 August","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/international-youth-day-12-august","essay_date":"Aug 12, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"It’s International Youth Day but it’s a day that encourages the older generation to lead, support and guide the youth.

Conviction. Self-belief. Reliance. Self-assurance. Certainty. Faith. These are just some of the words used to try and capture the essence of what it means to be confident. As you get older, you come to realise the role it plays in your life, its impact on your health and mental wellbeing. Confidence is a vital life skill and is needed in every area of life. And building confidence in the workplace can be the difference between thriving in your role or waiting impatiently for 4pm every day. What Is Meant By Confidence? According to the American Psychological Association, self-confidence is the “belief that one is capable of successfully meeting the demands of a task.” Confidence is key. It’s the unwavering self-belief that you can, you will, walking into every sense like you belong. Confidence is not letting what others may think or say about you affect the pursuit of your goals. It’s not questioning whether you can take up space, but owning your truth, power, skills, and abilities. When you are confident, you know who you are and own every part of you, flaws, imperfections, and everything in between. Benefits Of Being Confident Being confident has many benefits, at home, in your personal relationships, and at work. It’s a soft skill that can be transferred between the many areas of life. Here are a few benefits of being self-confident: Better communication Improved work-life balance Makes you a better team member or manager Increases positive response to feedback Helps you deal with conflict better Ultimately, confidence at work helps you perform your tasks better, and makes you are more productive. and helps boost your company’s brand perception. Confidence At Work Confidence is not always considered a necessary skill in the workplace. However, it is one of the “soft skills” that are gaining popularity in the workplace and needed for success. It’s labelled a soft skill because unlike other skills, it is not easily measured, nor tangible. Whether you are a team leader, manager, or general employee, it’s a must-have skill due to the changing nature of the workplace. Team members are more likely to take the lead and guidance from managers who are emotionally aware. That is, leaders who are confident in themselves that they don’t need to bully their subordinates or create unhealthy work environments to mask their lack of self-confidence. As a team member, being confident allows you to collaborate effectively with your team, you are part of creating a healthy work environment, there is healthy communication and teamwork at play. What Does Confidence Mean In The Workplace? Being confident at home or at play doesn’t always mean you’ll be confident at work. There are different tasks, needs, and demands at work that may require you to step into a part of yourself you haven’t tapped into yet. In your social circle and home life, you have often chosen the people around you. You also have long established ways of working and developed relationship dynamics on your terms. It’s not always the case in the workplace because you’re dealing with different personalities, temperaments, and situations that you can’t control. Because of the different elements at play here, it’s important to develop that self-confidence so that you don’t derail your professional goals. When you’re confident at work, it means: You can take criticism You aren’t afraid to make mistakes. You admit them, learn from them, and continue growing Increased your output You’re able to be a better advocate for yourself You know how to set boundaries and stick to them All in all, confidence contributes to workplace happiness, career growth, completing everyday work tasks well and overall performance. How To Build Your Confidence In The Workplace It’s important to remember that confidence isn’t something out of your grasp. It is something you can hone and develop over time with hard work, commitment, and dedication to creating a stronger version of yourself. Engage in positive self-talk This may sound corny to some, but you should never underestimate the power of your thoughts and words. It’s said that the words you speak create the house you live in. Get into the habit of speaking positive things (affirmations) about yourself. Loudly state your goals and what to plan to do to achieve them. Know your strengths Know what you can do and do it well. By performing these tasks and succeeding in them, you not only build confidence, but you make yourself a more valuable employee. You’ll be recognised for knocking these out of the park, giving you more responsibility and ultimately, boosting your confidence levels. That pat on the back and praise from your boss does wonders for your confidence. If you’re unsure about your strengths, take our workplace personality assessment. This test helps you recognise these as well as your weaknesses and offers a list of courses you can enrol in to develop your weaker areas and strengthen the stronger skills. Increase your knowledge The more you know, the more confident you’ll be on various subjects and your role at work. You’re bound to boost your self-confidence when you know and can speak eloquently and comprehensively about your job, the skills, software, tools, and trends related to your position. You’ll be called on to speak on this at work and with colleagues, trusted with information and counted on, which are great confidence boosters. Set goals We often hear how New Year’s resolutions get left by the wayside by mid-January or February. This is often because people haven’t broken them down into smaller achievable tasks. Without doing this, the goals begin to look overwhelming and impossible to meet. However, if you break these down into more manageable tasks, and you achieve them, your confidence in your abilities will grow. Fake it until you make it No, that’s not a typo. This long-standing saying holds merit. When you live confidently and perform with a confidence you may not yet feel, it tricks your mind into believing that you can and works to get you there. The positive reinforcement you’re likely to get creates a positive loop in your mind that builds your confidence up as you go. Confidence Boosters Learn from your mistakes. Develop more skills. Find a mentor. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Walk tall. These are a few other things you can do to build your confidence in the workplace. Remember, confidence is a skill you have the power to develop. Confidence can be learned. The big question is, how confident are you? It’s a simple question but it requires an honest look at yourself to determine whether it’s a skill you need to build from scratch or simply build on. “Once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight, or any experience that reveals the human spirit.” – E.

A wide range of courses, flexibility, opportunities to advance your career, and discover new hobbies or subjects. These are just a few of the reasons why online learning is gaining popularity. This month, we’re shining our Alison Learner Spotlight on Nwachukwu Chibuike from Nigeria, who has completed over 100 courses on Alison. This is his story. What is your current role? I do multiple jobs. First, I am a writer, public speaker, peer educators trainer and finally a pharmacy technician through Alison’s super platform. How did you find out about Alison? I found out about Alison through a Google search by surfing the internet to find free online courses. What made you choose to study with Alison? Alison’s courses are rich in content and free. What courses did you do? I did a lot of courses in Alison. To date, I have done 103 diploma and certificate courses with Alison. Actually, one of the first courses I took was a certificate course in Advanced Analytical Chemistry, Diploma in High School Chemistry, Diploma in Applied Chemistry, Advanced Cardiac Life Support, CPR, Diploma in Biology, Diploma in Mathematics, Diploma in International Convention and Maritime Law, Diploma in Modern Human Resources Management etc. How much time per week did you spend studying? Three hours. Sometimes four hours. How did the courses you completed prepare and help you in your career? It equipped me to be multifunctional and to better adapt to changing times. I feel confident to face the future. What skills or knowledge did you learn throughout the programme that you found most helpful in your career? I learnt how to dispense drugs, how to avoid medical and medication errors. I also learnt the processes of how to compound drugs. Did you experience any challenges while completing the course? Yes. The challenges are internet failures, low data bundles, and power outages. Other times, the challenges are making time to read after work and other family challenges such as doing chores. It’s not really easy, it is just determination and consistency. Again knowing what you want in life and being self-motivated. Are there any other courses you’d like to study through Alison? Yes. Principles of Epidemiology and the Diploma in Dental Assistants. What advice can you give to prospective Alison learners? Alison provides support to those who lack funds to further their education through the traditional system.

But you’ve done the research. You’ve studied the market. Put together a viable business plan and have secured funding. Now the time has come for you to make the leap from being an employee to an employer. Thankfully, there are lessons, skills, and experience you gained as an employee that you will be able to utilize as an employer. Below, we discuss going from employee to employer and the top transferable skills for your success. Employee vs Employer It’s important to understand how you have switched roles and the responsibilities that come with each position. The relationship between an employee and employer is a transactional one. The Employee As an employee, you work under a contract to render a service and perform tasks and services for the employer. There are pros to being an employee: Guaranteed income Set working hours Work-life balance The Employer Oversees these tasks and is the entity responsible for paying for these services. They also ensure that the business stays afloat. It has its perks: Independence Full creative freedom Financial growth However, when you run a business, it’s natural to want to do certain things yourself. But this is not always possible because others have skills you don’t possess, and your focus is on the management of the business, while you entrust them to run the operational side of things. Unless your business is a one-man-army, you need a team to help your business be all you envision it to be. How to Make an Easy Transition From Employee to Employer By now, you’ve been working for years and are comfortable as an employee. Life as an employer is different. The last thing you want to do is allow your experience as an employee to dictate how you will run your business and operate as an employer. It’s time to leave the employee mindset and adopt a business owner mindset. Here are a few tips to help you make the transition: Transition gradually The transition period will look different if you’re keeping your fulltime job and growing your business on the side. Alternatively, if you decide to go at being an employer full time, you’ll have to plan time and finances fully. Finding this balance is crucial to your success and not burning out before you’re fully into it. Whatever your approach, being fully organised and prepared are key. Set up a schedule As an employer, you’re no longer bound by the 8-4 working hours. You’re in charge of your own schedule. With it, comes a lot of freedom that need self-discipline and proper time management to ensure you get everything done. Luckily, as the employer, you can adjust your schedule to what suits you and meets your daily objectives. Prioritise You don’t have a manager or supervisor who assigns you tasks or projects as you would have as an employee. The ball is in your court to decide what needs to be done and when. Decide what’s important, what needs to be done, and the time needed to complete the task. Software tools and to-do lists are handy aids to ensure you are productive. Shoulder the responsibility The success or failure of your business falls on you as the owner and employer. This reality can be overwhelming if you aren’t psychologically prepared and aware of the responsibility of the position. When things go right, it’s a pat on the back for you. Equally, when things go wrong, it’s on your shoulders. Therefore, it’s essential to know your skills, strengths and be able to carry the differences that come with moving from employee to employer. What Are Transferable Skills? Transferable skills, also known as “portable skills,” are the abilities or expertise you have that can be utilised in any role or occupation. These skills are not limited to the workplace. They can be useful in different spheres of life like at school and in your social life. Jobs have certain requirements and a skillset. You have hard skills, which are easy to quantify. There are also soft skills, which aren’t as quantifiable but are often more important in certain roles than hard skills. Why Transferable Skills Are Important Digital technology and automation are the driving forces changing the job market and the ever-growing demand for transferable skills. In the past, people stayed with their employer for long stretches or until retirement. That landscape has changed, and people are changing jobs more often and many others, leaving jobs to start their own businesses. This breeds a need for continuous learning and skills development and knowledge to not only keep up but stay ahead of the game as an employer. Going from employee to business demands this learning and constant refreshing of skills to succeed.

New position. New challenges. A dream come true. Very few things come close to the excitement that comes with starting your new ideal job. The flip side of this coin are the nerves about meeting new people, impressing your new boss, finding your way, and not appearing clueless. When you’re starting a new job, or are a few days or weeks in, you want to have a successful introduction. We’re here to help. Keep reading for our top survival tips for your new job and putting your best foot forward. Each day, week and month during your probation period has its own tasks, responsibilities, and things you need to do while settling in. Each one will require something different for you. So, we’ve broken it down with tips for each week to help ease you in confidently. Week One: Surviving The ‘Newbie’ Stage Arrive early Arriving late on your first day or week won’t look good to your team, manager, or HR. Plan your trip with 30-minutes to spare to cover any delays like traffic, finding parking and finding your way. If you’ll be working remotely, test and check your connection ahead of time. Introduce yourself You’ll be meeting a lot of people in the first week, all with questions about who you are, what you do, which team you’ll fit in and where your background is. An elevator pitch will help respond and articulate yourself easier and quicker. Being able to share your passion, hopes, and what you’ll do will also help your team and company at large and get to know you. Learn the organisation chart There is no expectation for you to know everyone, their roles and where they fit in during your first week, or month. However, trying to know your new team structure and their roles will provide you with some insight into whom you will be working closely with and how the whole team and company operates. Ask questions When in doubt ask. There’s no such thing as a stupid question. If you don’t understand something, can’t remember where the cafeteria is or in doubt, ask. You don’t want to come across as a “know-it-all” and you certainly want to show you’re willing to learn. This will go down better than trying to figure it all out on your own. Week Two: Making Inroads Complete all the necessary training The onboarding process may continue into week two. This includes not just learning about the company structure and HR policies, but the different software, tools, and platform you’ll be using in your role. Even if you’re familiar with some of these from your previous roles, take notes where there are differences in how things are done. And if there are approvals, specifications and other processes utilised. This is also a good time to observe areas you may want to improve on as time goes on. Define and confirm your KPI’s and success You will have most likely met one-on-one with your manager to go over your role and responsibilities you talked about in the interview. Now is your chance to clarify things, go over the key elements and performance metrics you’ll be evaluated on. You can also use this week to learn about your manager’s leadership style, expectations, and what the individual, team and manager’s success looks like. Build relationships with your team No man is an island. This isn’t clearer than in the workplace. Your success is your team’s success. Conversely, your failure is your team’s failure. Building relationships will help you in creating smoother workflows, understanding team dynamics, and individual personalities and how to manage them. Long term, when you need a favour or are facing a deadline and need help, it will be the fostered relationships that will help you meet and win. Week Three: Survival Tips To Set Yourself Up Celebrate early wins and contribute You may be given new tasks and already roped into meetings and projects. These are great avenues to show what you’ve learned, how well you’ve picked up on systems and processes, and are adapting. Contribute, either by asking questions or making comments in meetings. Raise your hand and volunteer your skills to tasks that will help your colleagues succeed. They will see you, note your value, and you too will begin to feel more comfortable as you begin to cement your place in the team. Learn from difficult processes, procedures, and tasks Be gentle with yourself. You will make mistakes as you learn. What you do need to do is own up to them, learn from them, and show your team and manager that you can bounce back from any challenge. Build on from the previous weeks’ tips and continue asking questions and taking notes until you’re more comfortable in your role. Everything is a new learning curve and unless you’re Albert Einstein’s prodigy and know everything under the sun – every day and week is an opportunity to learn. Create new habits “If you are going to achieve excellence in big things, you develop the habit in little matters.” Small everyday acts will help you win! Make a conscious effort that you will not only commit but do things every day that will take you closer to your role. These include arriving at work on time, completing difficult tasks first, clearing your inbox daily and developing a system that will help you cope with the coming stresses and pressures of the job. Know who you are and what works for you and then cultivate habits that will exploit your strengths and improve your weak areas. Week Four: Surviving and Thriving Take ownership of your role You’re approaching the one-month mark in your new role and have spent weeks finding your feet and learning the ropes. Now is the time to buckle down and apply your skills to the challenges and pain points you’ve identified. Set three, six, nine and year long goals for yourself and what you’ll need to do to achieve each of them. One month check-in For some this may seem to be too soon in the game to sit with your manager and find out how you’re doing. You can request an informal chat with your manager to discuss your first month, identify priority tasks, lay your observations, suggestions and ask those questions that will help you go the rest of the way without them and your team holding your hand. This is also a great way to show great initiative and how much you’ve picked up on in your first month. Remember that your learning shouldn’t stop, irrespective of how comfortable you are with how things work. Remain open-minded Listen more than you speak Last, and not least, is to just be yourself. It’s a cliché but should not be overlooked. Only you have the skills, personality, experience, and character they need. Which is why and how you got the job. A new job is a big change in your life and a big step towards you achieving your career goals. Like all changes, there will be growing pains, unique challenges and adjusting and adapting to the new environment. All these can become overwhelming and if not well-managed, can impact your mental health.","length":6890,"tokens":1494,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Survival Tips For Your New Job","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/survival-tips-for-your-new-job","essay_date":"Jul 28, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"New company.

On Saturday, 23 July 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO), officially declared the monkeypox outbreak a world public health emergency. The bold decision by the WHO enables it and affected countries to seize measures to halt its spread. Read on to learn about Monkeypox and everything you need to know the viral outbreak. Monkeypox has for the past three years grown steadily in Africa and across the globe. In their public statement, WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noted that almost 17 000 Monkeypox cases had been recorded, almost 80 fatalities in 75 countries in 2022. The virus is continually spreading and this has garnered the world’s attention. What Is Monkeypox? The Monkeypox virus forms part of the group of viruses that causes smallpox, the variola virus. It is a rare disease resulting from infection of the Monkeypox virus and is considered a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family. It has similar symptoms to those found in smallpox patients. However, Monkeypox is a mild infection and is not often fatal. The source of the virus is yet to be determined, but it has been discovered that African rodents and non-human primates harbor the Monkeypox virus and subsequently infect humans. How Monkeypox Spreads Monkeypox is known as a ‘viral zoonosis’. This means it gets transmitted to humans from animals. This occurs when there has been direct contact with the blood and fluids of an infected animal. These include tree squirrels, rope squirrels, dormice, Gambian pouched rats, and different monkey species. It can also spread to humans via close contact with an infected person or by touching contaminated materials. Between humans, it is spread through bodily fluids, lesions, and respiratory droplets. Studies have found this transmission to also occur from mother-to-fetus and during and after birth. There are ongoing studies to better understand the risk associated with the spread of Monkeypox through sexual transmission. Signs and Symptoms of Monkeypox The period between infection and the onset of symptoms (incubation period) is between 6-13 days. This can also range from 5-21 days. Experts have divided the infection into distinct periods, each with its own set of symptoms: Invasion Lasts between 0-5 days Lack of energy Muscle aches Back pains and headaches Swollen lymph nodes Skin Eruption Skin erupts between 1-3 after signs of fever Rash concentrated on face, palms, and soles of the feet in majority of cases Rash changes from lesions to slightly raised lesions, to those filled with a clear fluid. These progress to lesions with a yellowish appearance which then forms a crust, dries up and falls off. Appearance of several or thousands of lesions The WHO adds that these symptoms can last between 2-4 weeks. Individuals with compromised immune systems may experience worse outcomes of the disease. Additional complications that can arise from Monkeypox include loss of vision, sepsis, encephalitis, and bronchopneumonia. Prevention Measures for Monkeypox The prevention strategy against Monkeypox is to increase people’s awareness of the various risk factors and steps on what they can do to reduce their exposure. Medical experts and scientific studies are underway to determine if vaccination is the best measure against this disease and to control its spread. Minimise human-to-human transmission Close contact with an infected individual is the most common way the virus is spread. Healthcare workers and their family members are at a greater risk of infection. This is due to the proximity with which they care for infected patients. It’s advised that those who have been vaccinated for smallpox and are well-trained to work with sample care for infected patients. Reduce of animal-to-human transmission The zoonotic transmission of the virus can be significantly reduced by ensuring all meat parts and food are thoroughly cooked. Additionally, we can reduce contact with sick or dead animals and their meat and blood by wearing protective clothing or being mindful of any unprotected contact with these parts. Restrict animal trade It’s important to note that certain countries have put measures in place to restrict the rodent and non-primate imports. Further regulations include isolating infected, or potentially infected animals from other animals and treating them with extra care for any Monkeypox signs and symptoms for up to 30 days. Monkeypox Treatment Currently, there is no specific treatment for Monkeypox. However, due to its similarity to smallpox, its drugs and vaccines can be used to treat the current infections. Research has revealed that those previously vaccinated against smallpox will experience milder Monkeypox symptoms. However, newer vaccines, the attenuated vaccinia virus, was modified and approved for Monkeypox in 2019. Further treatment includes care to alleviate the symptoms, control any complications and prevent long-term effects from the virus. Infected patients should also increase their fluid and food intake to maintain a strong immune system and high nutritional status. Alison’s Response to Monkeypox Education and awareness about infections, prevention and control remain the key elements to combat any virus we are faced with. Alison has a free course, Monkeypox, that answers all the questions about the virus and teaches you how you can protect yourself and others against the outbreak.","length":5553,"tokens":1090,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Monkeypox: Everything You Need To Know","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/monkeypox-everything-you-need-to-know","essay_date":"Jul 27, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Amid a global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic that devastated the world, the world finds itself facing another health crisis.

These family-friendly four-legged pets are incredible creatures that can reduce stress, play, encourage exercise, and ease feelings of loneliness. But there can be a disconnect with our beloved pets when we, as owners, don’t understand their behaviour and what they’re trying to communicate with us. This month, our Alison publisher spotlight interview is shining on Sharon Bolt. Sharon is a dog behaviour expert and she spoke to us about publishing on Alison, her courses, dog training and more. Sharon Bolt Background Please share with our learners a bit about your background. I ran a complementary therapy practice for over 10 years where I worked with individuals who had mental, physical, spiritual and emotional problems. I am also an author and co-authored two wonderful books called, ‘Successful Women in Business’ and ‘Every Entrepreneurs Guide: Running Your Own Business.’ How did you get into dog training? My husband and I decided to get two eight-week-old Parson Terriers in 2004, brothers from the same litter. We tried to enrol them into a puppy class, but the trainers all said the same thing to me: “You have taken on real trouble, it’s the worst-case scenario”. They explained that because the puppies were blood related, they would look at each other for direction rather than us and would fight for the ‘top dog’ position. This meant that aggression and nasty fights would result and we would very likely need to rehome one of them. My mission began to find a natural way of communicating with my two dogs in a way they would really understand and stop the worrisome predictions from coming true. I studied, went on courses, researched, and most importantly watched the way my two dogs communicated with each other. Around that time BBC Radio 2 was looking for a dog trainer to come on their show to talk about unwanted dog behaviours. Three days later I was on the show speaking to millions of listeners. That interview changed my life overnight. It launched my new dog training career and was the beginning of my journey. Being An Alison Publisher You’ve been a self-publisher with Alison for several years. What do you enjoy most about publishing on this platform? I love that Alison really cares about both their instructors and students. Alison has researched thoroughly into the best ways in which students learn and are committed to publishing only the highest quality courses on their site. As an instructor you know that you are being represented at the highest level. Alison has marketing experts and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) specialists who are dedicated to getting your course/s in front of the people who will benefit from your content. It is a great partnership that they offer for course creators. What lessons or takeaways have you learned as a self-publisher on Alison? I’ve learned that it’s important to include all learning modalities when creating a top-class course (written, audio and video). It’s important to create quizzes (with different Q&A formats) to ensure that the student has fully understood what has been taught during the lessons. How has being a self-publisher on Alison changed or impacted your life? I feel that being a self-publisher on Alison has made me a better course creator for my courses. Alison is a professional company and I feel that their ethics and high standards rub off on their self-publishers. What words of advice would you give someone who would like to become an Alison publisher? Becoming a publisher on Alison is a very thorough process, which is a good thing! There are online courses on Alison that help you with the required format and support articles that explain things step-by-step, plus the support from your account manager is brilliant. It can feel a bit overwhelming initially but is worth it, so go for it! Published Dog Training Courses on Alison by Sharon Bolt Please tell our learners about your courses on Alison. There are so many goodies to choose from! ‘The Ultimate Guide to Puppy Training’, ‘Dog Training Methods for Pulling on the Leash and Recall Training’, ‘Easy Dog Training Methods That Stop Dog Aggression and Dog Attacks’ and ‘Easy Dog Training Methods to Stop Dog Barking’. These four courses are for dog owners, regardless of their experience, who need help with the above unwanted behaviours, they are also for people who would like to become professional dog trainers and for people who are already professionals in the dog industry. ‘Become a Professional Dog Trainer’ is for people who have a desire to become a professional dog trainer. It’s also for someone who already works in the dog industry who would like to add ‘professional dog trainer’ to their services. People who would like to learn more in depth information about dogs to best support their own dogs can do this one too. ‘How to Run a Successful Dog Training Business’ is a business and marketing course for people who have (or would like to have) their own dog training business. It will also suit people who already have a dog related business, such as dog walkers, dog groomers, pet sitters etc. ‘Natural Remedies for Dog Illnesses’, ‘Dog Training’ and ‘How to Feed Your Dog a Raw Diet Using BARF or RMB Methods’ courses are for people who would like to know how to successfully treat and heal their dogs with natural remedies rather than using antibiotics and medication. ‘How to Master NLP and the Law of Attraction’ is for people who want more money, success, love, happiness, optimum health, and fun in their lives using the Law of Attraction and NLP techniques. Who should take your courses? I have 9 courses on Alison in total which means that the people who would benefit from taking my courses are somewhat varied. My courses are for dog owners, people who have a desire to become a professional dog trainer and for people who already work in the dog industry. My business and marketing course is for people who have (or would like to have) their own dog training business. For individuals interested in taking one of your courses, what can they expect to get from it? My dog training courses focus on empowering you, the dog owner. I give you the tools, knowledge and dog training methods that get your dog to listen to you and respond favourably to what you say. I also teach you exactly how to do the dog training methods through step-by-step video demonstrations. This uses the pack leader theory combined with positive reinforcement techniques. The methods I teach are simple, easy, and gentle. They will change a stressed-out dog (and owner) to a happy and well-behaved pooch fast. What feedback have you received from learners about your course? It’s so rewarding reading student’s feedback about my courses. Here is some of what people say: “Wow! This is a fantastic course – it’s obvious that Sharon knows her stuff and has a great way of explaining what to do in a way that makes sense and is ‘doable’. I love the idea of treating my dog naturally and this course has given me the knowledge to feel confident to do that. A ‘must have’ course for every dog owner – highly recommended!” – Amy Bentley. “So much wonderful information packed into these courses! Sharon breaks down the information and backs it up with videos in every scenario. I have a beautiful career in front of me working with dogs -Thank you, Sharon!” – Arin Davis “I loved this course and learned so much, not just in techniques, but in new ways of thinking about dog behaviour. Can’t wait to watch more courses! Highly recommended.” – Chase Night Why Dog Training Is Important Why should people be invested in training their dogs? So many dog owners that we speak to are at their wits end, they don’t know what to do. Often, their dog’s behaviour is going from bad to worse and they don’t know how to stop it. Dogs are not complicated animals – they just want simple, clear, and concise communication. By the end of my courses, you’ll have the dog training knowledge and confidence you need to make a positive difference to both yours and your dog’s lives. You’ll also know how you can become your dog’s pack leader without shouting, hitting, or using force. What misconceptions, if any, do people have about dog training and how would taking your courses help with this? The biggest problem I see is dog owners trying to ‘humanise’ their dogs. Dogs are animals and speak a different language, which is through non-verbal communication and body language. They also have different needs and expectations than humans and when misunderstood they display a host of stressed, hyperactive, and undesirable behaviours. That’s why I empower and educate dog owners on how to give the right communication to dogs and how to ‘speak dog’, when you get this right stressed out dogs become happy and well-balanced pooches. Becoming A Dog Trainer What set of skills should one acquire if they want to go into dog training? Building knowledge and confidence through online courses that have video demonstrations and written documents is a great way of gaining dog training skills. For people who’d like to become professional dog trainers they will need to know how to resolve many unwanted dog behaviours. Know how to run a professional business Marketing skills Learn how to create transformational packages for clients Hands-on experience is also vital for building confidence. I recommend volunteering at rescue centers and dog pounds and ‘practicing’ the skills learned online on your own dog/s plus friends and family dogs. What career paths are available for individuals interested in dog training? Becoming a professional dog trainer is a popular career path for people who are interested in dog training. We also find that people who already have a dog related business, such as dog walkers, dog groomers, pet sitters often want to add ‘professional dog trainer’ to their services and regularly enrol in my courses. What do you enjoy most about your job? I love hearing about (or watching) stressed out dogs become calm, happy, and well-balanced pooches once their owners apply the methods that I teach. Seeing how the dog owner’s confidence grows, how their self-belief soars and how empowered they feel makes me happy. I enjoy helping people to become professional dog trainers so that they can make a difference in the world and pay their bills at the same time. I take pleasure in teaching people how to use natural remedies to heal their dog’s ailments. They can use this knowledge to feed their dog a raw, natural diet that gives them optimum health, body weight and longevity. In a nutshell, I love EVERYTHING about my job! What The Future Holds For Sharon Bolt What else can Alison and its learners look forward to from you in the coming year to two? There are no plans at this time for additional courses, but you’ll be the first to know as and when that changes. Any last words, advice, or wisdom you’d like to share with our learners? Dog training takes time, consistency, and dedication. There’s nothing better and more rewarding in life than the strong bond and unconditional love shared between an owner and their dog. I highly recommend that you invest in either online dog training courses or local professional dog trainers (or both). With these, you will get the knowledge and methods that will give you a happy, well balanced, and well-behaved dog – both you and your dog will be pleased that you did!

There are over 150 active social media sites and over 3-billion people who use social media daily. Whether you’re an avid user of the plethora of applications available or just “don’t get it”, social media is here to stay. The hundreds of social media apps available mean there is a variety of apps to appeal to every taste, preference, industry, style and so much more. What started out as platforms for personal use has evolved into millions of companies relying on social media as a digital marketing tool. Like many things, there are rules on how to use and navigate apps. We’re breaking down social media etiquette and looking at the unspoken social media rules for business. What Is Social Media? “Social media” is the collective term used to speak about interactive technologies that drive communication, the sharing of information, ideas, common interests, thoughts, and expression across and through virtual networks. These platforms allow users to create web content and share it with others. Types Of Social Media Platforms There are many types of social media like blogs, instant messaging platforms, social networking sites, podcasts, photo-based sharing platforms, video sharing sites and so much more. Often, when you think of social media, the first thought is the social networking sites, but there are more types, each serving a specific function. Social Media Networks LinkedIn (primarily for business), Facebook, Twitter, are some of the more popular sites. These all encourage connections, sharing thoughts, ideas, and knowledge with friends, family, and acquaintances. You can create groups within these, have discussions, market your business and through advertising, allow businesses to enlarge their audience reach and discover key metrics through research that allows you to know your customers and cater to their needs. Discussion Forums You can have a conversation anywhere, but forums like Reddit and Quora service a different niche of communication. These discussion sites spark conversations where people can ask questions and attract people with like-minded curiosities within their sub-communities. For a business owner, you can set yourself up as an industry thought-leader by answering questions and use this to drive that audience to your business website. Consumer Reviews Sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, HelloPeter are examples of consumer review sites. These allow potential customers to review the experiences of other customers and let them know if that product, place, or service is worth the buy. Businesses can use these to track their customer sentiment, solve problems and improve customer experiences. Media Sharing Networks Ever heard the saying, “a picture is worth a thousand words”? Snapchat and Instagram are popular examples of these image sharing platforms. Businesses curate content that will attract audiences and customers and use this to sell your product. Through these, businesses can grow their audience organically using inspired content and engage their users, be it with the lifestyle, product offerings or other services shared on the page. Video Hosting Sites YouTube has changed the way we think about and consume video content. Where previously, video was limited to skilled professionals, today, anyone can become a ‘YouTuber’. Vimeo is another example of a video hosting site and businesses can optimise these to stream phenomenal business content in a way that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg like you would pay in television advertising. This list is by no means exhaustive as there are also blogs, bookmarking sites (Pinterest), new platforms like TikTok that businesses are optimising, and sharing economy sites like AirBnB that allow you to share and grow your business. It’s easy to get lost in the world of social media and try to have accounts for each one. However, this is not always practical, necessary, or beneficial for your business. As a business owner, you need to know which platforms are best suited for your business and will help you achieve your social media marketing strategy goals and objectives. Without a clear strategy, you can get caught up in the virtual world and end up performing cardinal sins which can be detrimental to your digital reputation. What Is Social Media Etiquette? Social media etiquette refers to the set of guidelines that individuals and organisations adhere to maintain their online reputation. In the same way there are rules about which fork to use for dinner, social media etiquette has rules about which platform to use and the best way to do so. This speaks to the often-unspoken set of rulers that govern online behaviour, that is, how we say and do to remain respectful and respectful with fellow users. Being on your best behaviour as a business is as important as maintaining personal etiquette on social media. Social Media For Business Should your business be on social media? What should you post, or not post? When should you post it? When should I like, share, or retweet a post? Which platform is best for my business? Government institutions and businesses, social media plays a key role in communication and keeping their audiences informed about what they’re doing, how they’re doing it and when. Social media allows businesses to achieve four key goals: Brings new customers to your business Helps you discover new ideas and trends that can grow your business Connects you with your existing customers in more meaningful ways Enhances your brand Social Media Etiquette Business Do’s And Don’ts Whatever you post on the internet will live forever – even if you delete it. In a split second, someone will have seen and “screen grabbed” what was shared and will, despite your best intentions, go on to share that with the rest of the world. If it was negative, it could have a disastrous effect on your business. Therefore, knowing and following social media etiquette will be your company’s saving grace. Do’s Separate your personal and business accounts. You don’t want to accidentally share memes on your business account that should be from your personal page. Fact check. Before posting, be sure of the facts. You don’t want to go viral for sharing fake news as a reputable business. Create content suitable for each platform. Research, know and understand which platforms are best fit for your business and tailor all your content for the specific platform and audience. Also learn content management strategies that will help align your business to the platform. Have a human touch. There are several social media management tools to help business plan calendars, manage work flows and conversations, measure ROI and get user insights. It’s created to automate some posts, but always leave room for the human touch and live responses and engagements. Have a social media guide and policy. This empowers your employees in knowing what to share, online safety, being your business representative, compliance, and best practices for each platform. Don’ts Don’t engage with trolls. These users live to get reactions and a rise out of others. Don’t take the bait and get drawn into a twar (Twitter war). Don’t overshare. Too many shares and updates will clog your audience’s timeline. If what you share is irrelevant to your business, you run the risk of losing customers and followers. Don’t “overpromote”. Find a healthy balance between organic posts and paid posts across all your platforms. Don’t complain, be negative or abuse hashtags (#). These online behaviours won’t endear your audience to further engage with your account or your business. Instead, adopt a positive response and reactions to criticism, post positive news and content and be moderate in your hashtag use. These are just some of the practices to adopt to ensure you post on the right side of the constantly changing social media landscape. If the past 10 years is anything to go by, we can be certain that the social media landscape and how we communicate with each other will continue to evolve. You need to keep up with the transformation and adopt social media etiquette practices for your business. Remember, just because you can say it, it doesn’t mean you should.","length":8215,"tokens":1637,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Social Media Etiquette: Do’s and Don’ts For Business","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/social-media-etiquette-dos-and-donts-for-business","essay_date":"Jul 19, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"There is no escaping social media.

The youth make up a significant percentage of the world’s population. This stark reality emphasises how important it is to shape, equip, and embrace their place in society knowing that it is them that will carry the successes and failures we create today. In the not-too-distant future, the older generation will be passing on the baton to young people to carry. What we’re all coming to realise is that the youth have to constantly adapt to the fast-changing world. They need to adopt necessary skills that will make the world liveable not just for them but future generations. World Youth Skills Day 2022 is a day that aims to embody this truth and rallies everyone globally to give them what they need to keep the fire burning. What Is World Youth Skills Day? Eight years ago in 2014, the United Nations (UN) made an announcement that every year on 15th July, the world would celebrate World Youth Skills Day. The goal of this day is to highlight the importance of the essential skills that are needed for the youth as they enter employment and pursue entrepreneurship. The day further provides its stakeholders, partners, businesses, development organisations, employers, and many others, to come together to raise awareness, open dialogue. This day creates an environment where the youth can acquire skills that will make them employable and employers. Furthermore, it serves to develop partnerships and strengthen sustainable development goals. This year’s theme is “Transforming youth skills for the future”. The Significance of World Youth Skills Day World Youth Skills Day, like many other days marked around the globe, is set to remind us of its value. This day highlights the ever-increasing need to pour into and equip young people with essential skills that will shape the future. It further provides opportunities for individuals, communities, and organisations to offer support to the young people around them. This can be achieved by creating training sessions, job fairs, mentorships, and work where they can develop and enhance their skills. It also serves as a reminder that children and young people need access to learning valuable skills is their right. And we should all endeavour to provide platforms where this learning can take place. What Crucial Skills Are Needed By The Youth? The world is changing. There is a large skills gap that is causing many youths to fall through the cracks and get left behind with the changing world. However, young people are resilient and are built with the ability to question, assess, evaluate, and discover not just the issues, but the solutions to resolve many of the issues facing the world. To do this optimally and effectively, they require a wider arc of skills to succeed. Interpersonal skills Financial literacy Digital literacy and technology skills Media literacy Communication Soft skills Collaboration and teamwork Leadership This list is by no means exhaustive. Instead, it indicates the most cited and required skills for youth entering any industry or for success as an entrepreneur. How Alison Is Supporting World Youth Skills Day The UN and its supporting bodies recognise the numerous challenges facing the youth. Their Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by the UN in 2015, were a call to action to the world to work together to end poverty, protect the world and help make peace and prosperity a reality for all by 2020. Education is one route that can propel this change. Alison is dedicated to empowering individuals of every age and background. We believe that by offering access to free courses around a range of subjects, we can reduce the burden of poverty, offer critical solutions to personal, economic and career growth, and highlight creativity and innovation amongst others. We are committed to helping achieve these goals with focused alignment in the below areas: No poverty Quality education Gender equality Decent work and economic growth Industry, innovation, and infrastructure Reduced inequalities Sustainable cities and communities The youth, as key drivers and future leaders, play a pivotal role in remaining informed, engaged, and skilled to meet the 2030 goals.

Countries have reopened their borders to visitors, social events and gatherings are back on the calendar, you can walk around unmasked and you can make your way back to the office. But the latter is not one that people are jumping to get back into. For most people, working from home is their new normal, with some choosing to resign or take lower pay in lieu of returning to the office. We’re laying the pros and cons of each working solution to help you decide if you should continue working from home or return to the office. Working From Home Working remotely was growing in popularity at the start of the pandemic. Today, more jobs and companies have adapted to these options and it’s becoming the preferred option for many. The Benefits of Working From Home No commute Your home-office commute is now shortened from your bedroom to your home office. You save hours on travel and money spent on fuel. With global rising fuel costs, every cent counts. Flexible work schedule Lucky employees can work flexibly if their contracted hours are met, and their tasks and deadlines are complete. This allows one to develop a health work-life balance which greatly impacts your overall well being. What makes working from home more appealing is that now you can be your own boss and make a good living. Increased productivity Many individuals have found that they are more productive at home than at the office. In some cases, this is done to prove that they are as productive at home as they are in the office. Risk of lower output would force a move back to the office. Communication skills Emails, meetings and chats have to be direct, clear and defined in order to limit miscommunication. Developing effective communication skills, both written and verbal improves relations and does not poorly affect your team’s output. A useful work from home guide with few tips and tricks on how to make this transition seamless is what you need. These tools help you rethink and change your daily lives to make working from home work. The Disadvantages of Working From Home Technical issues If anything breaks, you either must call out a technician to fix it or drive to the office for your tech team to look at it. This can be costly and take up time driving to the office and back and as a result, losing working hours. Domestic distractions A quick nip to the shops, another hour at the bank. Cleaning, laundry, watching the kids, taking out the garbage and a million other tasks that suddenly demand your attention during your working hours. Limited socialisation You’re limited to talking with your teammates on Teams or in Zoom calls. There are no more face-to-face conversations as when in the office. Self-discipline You need to discipline yourself to know that work time is just that, work time and not time to do everything else you didn’t find time to at the weekend. Your productivity will be monitored by your managers and thus, maintaining your office hours at home needs to be kept as well as possible to meet goals and deadlines. The truth is, working from home requires discipline and willpower to not get distracted by the errands, chores and domestic tasks you’re faced with when you move from room to room. It’s very easy to put in a load of laundry when you should be finishing that task. Knowing when to work and when to ‘be at home’ is key so that the two don’t bleed into each other. Our time management course is a great way to learn how to manage your time and meet your respective goals. Working From The Office If you find yourself struggling with staying focused at home, then you may be part of the crowd that prefers working from the office. It has its own set of pros and cons and essential soft skills to master the workplace. The Benefits of Working From The Office Defined work hours You know what time you knock on and off at the office and when you close your laptop, you’re mostly done for the day. Working from home isn’t always as clear cut as this is. Access to technical support and equipment Unless you’re an IT guru, when your computer or laptop or connectivity goes down, the IT team is on hand to fix it – at no call-out cost to you. You could also get access to a replacement laptop which means no downtime and work can continue without too much hassle. Less distractions All you have in front of you is your work and no pets that need walking, children that need to be monitored or dishes in the sink that need to be washed. When all you have to focus on is work, your task list can get whittled down much quicker. Social interactions and networking You can engage with your colleagues at the water cooler, have robust discussions about everything under the sun, meet new people and connect with other associates you wouldn’t necessarily get the opportunity to in person. The Disadvantages Of Working From The Office Working from the office does pose its fair set of challenges. Most jobs are online and can be done with a laptop and secure internet connection. At the office, you have to deal with office politics, where to park and a host of other issues that become frustrating over time. Lack of balance Workplace pressures, stresses and demands can place a lot on your mental health. Spend a few minutes to take our mental wellbeing assessment and find out how you’re coping with the various demands from work and home. Less time with family You spend a lot of time commuting to and from the office. When you finally get home, you have a ton of chores to do and maybe spend another or two completing work tasks. Dress code Some jobs require their employees to keep to a strict dress code. Many people have now gotten used to more comfortable and less restricted attire in their home office. You just have to remember to switch your gown for a formal jacket in those video conferences. Sedentary lifestyle from sitting all day Sitting for 8 hours at your desk is not conducive to healthy living. At home, you can get closer to your 10 000 daily steps walking from room to room in your house. Costs of commute You wake up a bit earlier. You may spend a significant amount of time in traffic. Petrol and diesel costs are high and the resulting carbon emissions have a negative impact on the air. Some personalities thrive and are more productive in an office environment than when working from home.

Teachers can open the door for you, but it is up to you as a learner to enter by yourself. To do this, you need a teacher that will not only instruct them on the material, but draw out their potential, ignite their fire to learn and make learning interesting. This month, we’re shining our Alison Learner Spotlight on Judy Griffiths, a passionate and invested online English teacher. She spoke of her desire to continue learning and impart her knowledge on her students and how her learnings have enriched her teaching methods. This is her story. What is your current role? I work as an ESL teacher – teaching English to foreign learners. I also run a small tutoring company. I primarily teach and tutor children between grade 1 and grade 7. How did you find out about Alison? I have always had a great love for academics and was searching online for courses that would enhance my skills and qualifications. A Google search on online courses led me to Alison. What made you choose to study with Alison? I read that there are online courses and certificates available and I could join millions of graduates. Those who know me, know that I love studying short courses and of course, especially for free. I was drawn to the portal and the structure, the way Alison has set out its modules – each with a preview of what the course is about and it also has assessments. All of this for free. What courses did you do? I am doing a total of seven (7) courses at the moment and have completed two. I have a Diploma in Basic English Grammar and I have a certificate in Grammar and Vocabulary. How much time per week did you spend studying? I came across Alison at the beginning of the pandemic and being at home, I found I had a lot of time on my hands. I approached my studying like proper school, so everyday, Monday to Friday. Now however, I dedicate 2 hours daily, 3 times a week. How did the courses you completed prepare and help you in your career? For me, ‘help’ is a soft word. “Enabling” is a great one because Alison enabled me to have confidence. Alison carries a philosophy in that they don’t just teach you theory. You have interactive videos that put into practicality. You have assessments and comprehension check questions that monitor how much of the content you comprehend and thus building your confidence. This all enabled me to start my own tutoring company because the course equipped me and ensured I was fully competent for my career. What skills or knowledge did you learn throughout the programme that you found most useful in your career? Because Alison doesn’t just teach theory, but gives you practical examples you can apply to your everyday life, I remembered one such illustration of behaviourism of a child in class and the reinforcements that come with other kids’ reactions. I am able to understand and apply my knowledge in my teaching, understanding my kids and also how to help them. Did you experience any challenges while completing the course? The first challenge was time management. The second was data -it’s a bit expensive in South Africa, but it’s manageable now and I have dedicated set times and specific amounts to my studies. Apart from these, no other challenges because Alison courses are simplified and for the lay-man like myself- it’s not difficult. Are there any other courses you’d like to study through Alison? There are many courses I want to do. There’s a business English course focused on entrepreneurship, Diploma in Educational Psychology, and one that is really close to my heart is the Diploma in Special Needs. What advice can you give to prospective Alison learners? First and foremost, take your courses seriously, as if you are walking into Harvard or another recognised institution. Alison is no exception. Plan your time well. Take your courses and assessments seriously and just because it’s free, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t put in the effort. Alison is there to teach and empower you.

Teachers can open the door for you, but it is up to you as a learner to enter by yourself. To do this, you need a teacher that will not only instruct them on the material, but draw out their potential, ignite their fire to learn and make learning interesting. This month, we’re shining our Alison Learner Spotlight on Judy Griffiths, a passionate and invested online English teacher. She spoke of her desire to continue learning and impart her knowledge on her students and how her learnings have enriched her teaching methods. This is her story. What is your current role? I work as an ESL teacher – teaching English to foreign learners. I also run a small tutoring company. I primarily teach and tutor children between grade 1 and grade 7.","content_length":836,"content_tokens":174,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Learner Spotlight: Judy Griffiths","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-learner-spotlight-judy-griffiths","essay_date":"Jul 1, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"How did you find out about Alison? I have always had a great love for academics and was searching online for courses that would enhance my skills and qualifications. A Google search on online courses led me to Alison. What made you choose to study with Alison? I read that there are online courses and certificates available and I could join millions of graduates. Those who know me, know that I love studying short courses and of course, especially for free. I was drawn to the portal and the structure, the way Alison has set out its modules – each with a preview of what the course is about and it also has assessments. All of this for free. What courses did you do? I am doing a total of seven (7) courses at the moment and have completed two. I have a Diploma in Basic English Grammar and I have a certificate in Grammar and Vocabulary.","content_length":841,"content_tokens":177,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Learner Spotlight: Judy Griffiths","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-learner-spotlight-judy-griffiths","essay_date":"Jul 1, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"How much time per week did you spend studying? I came across Alison at the beginning of the pandemic and being at home, I found I had a lot of time on my hands. I approached my studying like proper school, so everyday, Monday to Friday. Now however, I dedicate 2 hours daily, 3 times a week. How did the courses you completed prepare and help you in your career? For me, ‘help’ is a soft word. “Enabling” is a great one because Alison enabled me to have confidence. Alison carries a philosophy in that they don’t just teach you theory. You have interactive videos that put into practicality. You have assessments and comprehension check questions that monitor how much of the content you comprehend and thus building your confidence. This all enabled me to start my own tutoring company because the course equipped me and ensured I was fully competent for my career.","content_length":866,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Learner Spotlight: Judy Griffiths","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-learner-spotlight-judy-griffiths","essay_date":"Jul 1, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"What skills or knowledge did you learn throughout the programme that you found most useful in your career? Because Alison doesn’t just teach theory, but gives you practical examples you can apply to your everyday life, I remembered one such illustration of behaviourism of a child in class and the reinforcements that come with other kids’ reactions. I am able to understand and apply my knowledge in my teaching, understanding my kids and also how to help them. Did you experience any challenges while completing the course? The first challenge was time management. The second was data -it’s a bit expensive in South Africa, but it’s manageable now and I have dedicated set times and specific amounts to my studies. Apart from these, no other challenges because Alison courses are simplified and for the lay-man like myself- it’s not difficult. Are there any other courses you’d like to study through Alison? There are many courses I want to do.","content_length":946,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Learner Spotlight: Judy Griffiths","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-learner-spotlight-judy-griffiths","essay_date":"Jul 1, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"There’s a business English course focused on entrepreneurship, Diploma in Educational Psychology, and one that is really close to my heart is the Diploma in Special Needs.

Every year hundreds of representatives from around the globe gathers at the eLearning Africa Conference to discuss, share ideas, collaborate, educate, and inform about the future of education throughout Africa. 2022 was no different.

Alison, a proud sponsor of the event, was there to meet some of the learners who have completed various courses and find out how their lives have been empowered through access to free online learning. These are some of the graduate stories of how Alison is changing lives through eLearning in Kigali, Rwanda. Lowami Umiwana “Learning is the way to grow, and Alison provides a free way to do that.” Lowami is a young gentleman whose passion and excitement were clear to see on his face. He said that before enrolling in Alison, he didn’t know the differences between software engineering and IT. But, though his studies, he developed his communication skills, and he has a better understanding of these differences between software engineers and IT technicians. He also learned how to communicate better with his team at work and provide them with what they need. Mwaka Abdulkarim Mwaka works as a gym instructor from Rwanda’s Ruyenzi Village. He shared his Alison story with us. Janvier “It was amazing to spend time with Alison.” Javier came into the conference with an undergraduate degree already in the bag. However, he recognised the boost that studying additional courses and developing skills to amplify his degree. Mixed with his love for food, he studied hospitality and learned how to cook. These insightful courses were in HR, IT Management, Food Processing and Food and Safety Hygiene. Innocent Karengera “I hope to do more courses from Alison because they are interesting and at the same time, they are free.” Meeting Innocent was a reminder to all of us that you are never too young or old to learn something new, and you are never too educated to. He holds a Masters degree but recognised that he needed additional skills in statistics and quality improvement to help him get closer to his dream of working as an independent consultant. Through Alison, he graduated with two additional diploma courses and two certificates. Iragena Rafiki “…to study is easy.

World Wellbeing Week (27 June – 1 July) is a reminder for everyone, regardless of age, background, or station in life, of the importance of wellbeing to our lives and livelihoods. We’ve put together a few tips to help you improve some of these wellbeing areas and the free Alison courses you can enrol in to help get you there. The pursuit of wholeness and one’s “wellbeing” has over the last few years, become vital to our lives. We’ve learned how it contributes to our capacity to take on everyday tasks, be joyful, and adapt to the ebb and flow of life. Wellbeing is the art of developing comprehensive, holistic, and healthy habits that result in better physical and mental health. Our wellbeing is made up of different components like financial, physical, spiritual, emotional, and mental wellbeing. Each one plays in informing who we are. Financial “A person either disciplines his finances or his finances disciplines him.” With economic downturns, threats of recessions, rising food, fuel costs and inflation, financial stability and economic welfare has never been more important. This refers to the state where an individual can meet all their current financial obligations, have confidence in their financial future and be able to enjoy life in the present. Tips to become financially sound: Don’t spend money before you have it Live beneath your means Draw up a budget and stick to it Plan for your retirement Know how much you have coming in and how much is going out Decrease your debt Be cautious with credit Save Money has one language: save me today; and it will save you tomorrow. Physical Your physical health is more the absence of disease in the body. Instead, it speaks to the overall lifestyle choices that include diet, sleep, exercise to ensure your body performs at its most optimum level and you can get through the day without fatigue and physical stress. You’re never too young, or old, to invest in and look after your body. Small everyday changes can get you on your way. Tips to improve your physical health: 10 000 steps, 30 minutes of physical activity or exercise – get your body moving Hydrate. Drink lots of water Get 6-8 hours of sleep every night Adopt a healthy diet, limit alcohol intake These boost your energy levels, improve your sleep, reduces lethargy, and gives you that extra spring in your step. You wake up feeling good and have a sense that you have everything you need to conquer the day ahead. Mental Our mental health affects everything we do (and don’t do), how we think, live, and feel. And state of wellbeing enables us to cope better with the daily challenges of life and helps us thrive in relationships, at work, home, play and make healthy choices. Mental wellbeing is something you can work on everything else we may face. Tips to improve your state of mind: Practice mindfulness. Be aware of your thought patterns and think about what you think about. Positive thinking can influence your feelings Learn a new skill or take up a new course. Make time for leisure and relaxation Develop a nutritious and healthy diet and lifestyle Sleep Connect with friends and family Reduce time spent on social media Get help Emotional We experience a wide range of emotions – sadness, happiness, anger, frustration, fear, anxiety, joy. Sometimes all in a day. This is perfectly normal and says nothing else except that we are human. Our emotional health and wellness refer to one’s ability to handle their emotions, to have the self-awareness, understanding and the acceptance of your varying emotions. It’s influenced by a number of factors like stress, physical wellbeing, environmental factors and relationships. By cultivating our emotional wellbeing, we become equipped to face hardships, find happiness and thrive. Tips to improve your emotional health: Build a strong support system Seek to create a balanced lifestyle Manage stress Be kind to yourself Talk about your feelings and ask for help Together, these four aspects contribute to a stronger and healthier version of yourself. Your wellness matters. It affects who we are, what we do, and is crucial for you to enjoy a high quality of life.

To teach English is to open the doors to the world. The covid-19 pandemic, if anything, has taught us that life is short, and you can work from anywhere, doing just about anything. Globally, we saw a steep rise in remote working and people opting to pack it all up to live, work and travel on the go. One of the careers that saw a change is that of teaching – moving from the classroom to online. It’s never easier to build your career online and from anywhere in the world. The career of choice for many individuals looking to live the work, travel and get paid to do it is being a TEFL teacher or instructor. Read on for your TEFL guide to the world. What is TEFL? TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) is an internationally recognised programme hosted in countries where English is not the primary language. The TEFL certificate and qualification allows native English-language speakers to teach English to students across all age groups and at every level in the specific country. TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) is the term used to cover teaching that includes both TEFL and TESL. Benefits of TEFL There are many benefits to obtaining a TEFL certificate. The least of these being the opportunity and freedom to travel and explore other countries and getting paid to do it. Added to these benefits, TEFL holders can: be a more effective instructor to your students access to better job opportunities higher salary and pay scale flexibility teaching skills for challenging situations a broader skill set boosts confidence for teaching in the classroom and online. And even better…it’s valid forever. Which means if you decide in your later years to travel again, you won’t have to retake the course. TEFL Teacher Guide Qualifications Standing in front of a class of learners, no matter their age, is not as easy as it seems. There’s skills, techniques, and methods you need to know to not just recite lesson plans from a book but ensure the message and knowledge is imparted to your students. An undergraduate teaching degree equips you with these skills. The good news is for most countries, you don’t need to have a four-year degree in order to teach a foreign language. Many countries across South America and Asia will hire you if you have accredited TEFL certification. The proper TEFL certification will give you the right training and qualifications you need to begin teaching. Alison offers a FREE Guide to Teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) to arm you to succeed in your journey. However, like in most cases where you’re applying for jobs alongside other candidates, you want to set yourself apart from the rest and stand out to the recruitment teams. You can take additional courses like The Crucial TEFL Guide to bolster your skills and give you the edge others may not have. TEFL Guide: 6 Ways to Win Over Your Class If you’re a TEFL teacher or looking to become one, you need support and resources to enhance your work for learners of every age group. Engage your students. Create lesson plans and content that will interest your learners and will make them enjoy not just coming to class but enjoying the process of learning. Have a plan and objective for your lessons. Know what you want to teach and find the right ways to do this. Prepare pair and group work. This gives your learners opportunities to put into practice what they’ve learned. Create a fun, activity-based learning environment. Use games and activities to make learning more interesting. Don’t be afraid to be different. Bring your own style, personality, and creativity to the classroom and connect with your learners in a way that only you can. Develop your teaching skills and be confident. Study. Ask questions. Explore. Teaching English as a Foreign Language is a two-way learning street. The students leave the classroom able to speak one more language and you, the teacher, a world of priceless experiences. Career Options With A TEFL Qualification A TEFL qualification opens the doors to many more opportunities. There is global growth potential, and you won’t always have to stand in front of a classroom. As you gain experience as a teacher and expand your skill set with different courses, you can begin to explore teaching assistant positions, senior teaching positions and managerial posts. You can pursue being a Director of Studies at English Language Centres, be a course developer, venture into linguistics, teaching business English to corporations looking to go international, training other teachers and more.

When you enrol for a few short, informative and skills rich courses like the ones available through Alison, you give yourself and career a great start. You leave each course having acquired essential knowledge and skills, you improve the skills you already have, and you learn how to communicate with others and in different environments.

We hear conversations, read books, and listen to talks on what it means, how to raise emotionally intelligent children, the different types of emotional intelligence, and how it can make you a great leader, partner, and individual. Ei4Change, an Alison publisher and expert in this field, shared a few thoughts on emotional intelligence and spoke to us about the importance of developing this trait and we should each take time to invest in it. Please share with our learners a bit about your background. My name’s Robin Hills. I am an emotional intelligence coach, trainer and facilitator. I live in NW England where I run a business focused on helping people in business to develop themselves and their careers through increased self-awareness and how they relate to other people. How did you get into emotional intelligence coaching? I had a number of roles in the corporate world in selling, marketing and in leadership, which gave me some great experience of working with and through people. I learnt a lot about human interaction, and behaviour and how this related to emotional intelligence even before emotional intelligence had become recognised for what it is. Over the years, there have been three occasions when my role was made redundant, and these gave me the chance to determine what I needed to do to gain further knowledge and skills. I became qualified to work with a variety of well-known, well-respected personality and behavioural assessments and registered with the British Psychological Society. I am a committee member of the Association of Business Psychology. There are very few openings as an emotional intelligence coach so I had to create the opportunities for myself. This is fundamentally what Alison offers people through online education – build your knowledge and skills in the areas that interest you and take this understanding and use it to your advantage. How does emotional intelligence affect our daily lives? As human beings, everything we do is underpinned by our emotions. Our emotions are the way that we react psychologically and physiological to our environment, so understanding how we respond to situations can help us improve the way that we interact with circumstances as they change and how we engage with others. Why should people be invested in developing their emotional intelligence? Emotional intelligence is being smart with our feelings in order to make good decisions and build authentic relationships. It is involved in communication, conflict management, collaboration, team work, leadership, etc. All the important functions that are involved within our lives. What misconceptions, if any, do people have about emotional intelligence and how would taking your courses help with this? Emotional intelligence is not a soft option, in fact it is one of the hardest to learn about and to apply. One of the main misconceptions is that emotional intelligence is about being kind and nice. These are great values to work with, but emotional intelligence is about being assertive and ensuring that people are not taken advantage of and to right what is wrong in the world. How does developing one’s emotional intelligence affect the workplace? Your emotions are going to affect those working around you whether you are aware of it or not. As a leader, your emotions can influence the performance of yourself and others by up to 45%. If you are continually angry with those reporting to you, why should they be happy working for you? How important is emotional intelligence to one’s mental well-being? Vitally! Part of emotional intelligence involves the practice of mindfulness, which is the awareness that arises through paying attention, on purpose, non-judgmentally to what is going on in the present moment. Doing this effectively, helps you cope better with stresses and build your resilience. (I did say that practising emotional intelligence is not easy!) You’ve been a self-publisher with Alison for several years. What do you enjoy most about publishing on this platform? There is a very strict procedure to follow to get a course published. Having courses published on other platforms, I was surprised around this especially as the courses are free. It brings a high level of quality and consistency to Alison courses. But, beyond this, there is the support of the team at Alison and a very helpful Personal Account Manager to guide and support me along every step of the way. What lessons or takeaways have you learned as a self-publisher on Alison? My biggest lesson has been around how to write learning outcomes. This means that I have to direct my attention and course content on the learner and what skills they will be able to do once they have taken the course. It may not seem like such a big deal, but it requires a complete shift in focus and is not that easy (until the ability is developed). My courses have improved massively due to this focus as it enables me to structure and deliver the content focused more on what learners want to learn about rather than what I want to tell them! I now realise how few learning instructors creating courses on other platforms can do this. How has being a self-publisher on Alison changed or impacted your life? I have been able to touch and make a difference to the lives of people all over the world. If it changes their lives for the better, it impacts on my life and my legacy. What words of advice would you give someone who would like to become a publisher on Alison? Just go for it! It is not hard, but you need to be determined and have tenacity. It takes time – much, much more time than you think. Use your emotional intelligence! Be focused, be consistent in your approach, be adaptable and most of all enjoy it. Who should take your courses? Anyone who is interested in learning more about themselves and their relationships with others. For individuals interested in taking one of your courses, what can they expect to get from it? A lot of hard work! A lot of self-reflection and soul searching and greater insights into who you are. Learning about emotional intelligence is very easy, putting it into practice and making changes is not easy and is the hard part. What feedback have you received from learners about your course? The feedback has been phenomenal. I am deeply touched by some of the thanks and stories that I have received. What else can Alison and its learners look forward to from you in the coming year or two? I am continually looking at ways to bring the messages about emotional intelligence to a wider audience so look out for more courses. For those who have enjoyed my courses, these new courses will help build your knowledge and understanding giving you different perspectives on emotional intelligence. Also, I am keen to embrace new ways that people learn as technology develops so I need to continually ensure that my skills improve to build appropriate aspects of AI (artificial intelligence), gamification, etc. into my courses. How will this change over the coming decade? Nobody knows so I need to keep abreast of it and incorporate it into my courses as things evolve. Any last words, advice or wisdom you’d like to share with our learners? None of us know what the future holds. Keep an open mind, keep striving for more knowledge, and keep learning. Nobody else can be you – so be the best version of you that you can be. The Principles of Emotional Intelligence, Leadership and Coaching course will be the difference between being a self-aware whole rounded extraordinary leader and being ordinary. Here, you will learn how this contributes towards your life skills, helps you in making decisions at work and at home and helps you build stronger and healthier relationships. Your healing journey is a four short course away.

Stress is the feeling and reaction you experience to any physical, emotional, or psychological strain. Our bodies are naturally designed to deal with stress. Our bodies signal to us through various physical responses of issues that need to be addressed. When a work deadline is looming, positive stress can push you to perform and deliver the task. Away from work, the small bursts of stress serve as your body’s survival instinct kicking and helping avoid danger. Prolonged bursts of stress can negatively impact the mind and body and can become chronic. “It’s not stress that kills us; it is our reaction to it.” Hans Selye The Dangers of Stress and How to Manage it What Causes Stress? We spend a third of our lives at work. That’s thousands of hours in a lifetime. Deadlines, difficult managers, team members, career switching, changing work environments and simply not having enough hours in the day can all contribute to stress. It’s exhausting. It’s overwhelming. The workplace can be taxing. But it’s not just work. There are many different factors that contribute to stress which can be both internal and external factors: Parenting challenges Studies Personal relationships Financial worries Work Major life changes Each of these affects us differently and our ability to cope with ease differs, but if you are able to identify the warning signs of stress, you will be able to manage it better. Types Of Stress Three main types of stress can be identified: Acute stress: these stresses are a result of a traumatic experience like the death of a loved one, an accident, injury, or violation. Survivors often end up developing unhealthy coping techniques like using alcohol and emotional detachment. In worst-case scenarios, it can turn into PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) which can last for years. Chronic stress: this a prolonged stress on an individual due to a recurring stressor. These stressors can be work-related or relational. It becomes chronic because they are long-lasting, are more difficult to manage and can end up causing chronic conditions like high blood pressure and anxiety. Eustress: this is also known as the body’s “fight or flight” response to dangers and threats. It raises your awareness and the burst of adrenaline that comes with it prompts your body to either fight or run from the danger. The Dangers of Stress Stress is mental and emotional, but its effects can be physical too. When we can’t find healthy ways to deal with stress, it can be debilitating on our bodies, affecting our health. Other effects of stress are: Anxiety in the workplace Insomnia Headaches, dizziness, migraines Digestive problems High blood pressure Lack of motivation, restlessness, lack of focus For many of us, stress is manageable, however, for a vast number of people, their 9-5 and personal stressors are more than they can handle. We can’t run from work or the challenges, responsibilities, and realities of life. This means we must find healthy and productive ways to cope with stress in every area of our lives. Our course on stress management in the workplace provides you with the skills you need to know to deal with the different pressures we all face. Tips on How to Manage Stress Exercise and relax. This can’t be stressed enough. Taking time to relax the mind, body and soul releases the tensions in the body.

When you arm your body with the right nutrients, you arm it to fight some of the effects can have on your body. It also reduces lethargic feelings, giving you the strength to face and fight the stresses that come your way with a fresh, clear mind and body. Create goals Procrastination is the thief of time.

It’s not always easy to do, but this means you’ll be able to adjust and adapt to unexpected life emergencies when they arise. You are better able to handle what falls on your plate because you have a working system that keeps things in check. Find balance The body is designed to withstand and do a lot.

The more that you learn, the more places you will go.” – Dr Seuss If we’re honest, studying is not always easy to do. There’s an aspect of fun, excitement, the adventure of learning something new, discovering new skills to win at something and challenging yourself to greater heights. On the other hand, the art of balancing work and studies can become a bit overwhelming and leave you wondering if you can do it. The good news is, Yes You Can! But we all need a little encouragement along the way and hear from those who’ve successfully done it to remind you that you can too. Today, we want to introduce you to one of Alison’s proud Alison graduates, Gloria Alado. We sat down one-on-one with her to find out about her learning experience with Alison, how it has grown her career and some words of wisdom for anyone looking to study further and achieve career success. What is your current role? I work as a recruitment specialist. How did you find out about Alison? I found Alison via LinkedIn. What made you choose to study with Alison? Online learning is a lifeline to those who want to continue working and studying simultaneously. The “flexibility, clarity and in-depth explanations” of the courses are some of the reasons why I chose to study through Alison. What courses did you do? Alison is a great online learning platform. Not just because of the flexibility it offers its students, but because of the range of courses available to choose from. She told us that she has completed several courses to help boost and draw her closer to her career goals. These include a Diploma in HR, Recruitment, The Recruitment and Onboarding Process and Modern Recruitment. How much time per week did you spend studying? I dedicated four days per week to studying. How did the courses you completed prepare and help you in your career? “It helped me advance and have mastery in my career. I got to understand other areas of recruiting and was able to apply the knowledge gained to my work.” What skills or knowledge did you learn throughout the program that you found most useful in your career? Although the various courses were in the same field, each focused on a different aspect and thus produced learnings and skills. Teamwork, sourcing, and time management are some that come immediately to mind. Did you experience any challenges while completing the course? For some, the switch from face-to-face learning to online learning can be daunting. But the structure, flexibility and ease of our courses didn’t pose any challenges for me. Are there any other courses you’d like to study through Alison? Alison has over 4000+ courses and there’s always something new to learn, skills to develop and areas to grow in. My academic journey is not yet finished. I am still taking and will continue to take more courses. What advice can you give to prospective Alison learners? “Start now. There are so many things to learn in order to become an expert in your career. So, start now and be AMAZING!” How do you stay motivated during studying? “I put my learnings into immediate practice as I proceed” with the course material. If you, like Gloria, are interested in pursuing a career in HR, our Fundamentals of Human Resources course is a great place to start your journey. For the seasoned HR professional, a certificate in Strategic Human Resource Management and Development will teach you the essential skills to effectively improve productivity within your team and get the most out of each member.

The stressors may be work-related, family issues, illness, financial worries, and in the past two years, growing anxiety around the coronavirus pandemic. These stresses look different for everyone and are experienced at different levels. Some can deal and work through these issues, but for others, they are a challenge. At their peak, these can affect the productivity of a workforce and for others, this can be a precursor for mental health issues and distresses. Mental health conversations are often shrouded in shame, stigma, secrecy, and a lot of misinformation. Despite all the efforts made to educate society on the realities and challenges of mental health, it remains a taboo. In the workplace, it’s an even bigger challenge because of the scepticism towards those who have mental health issues. What are mental health disorders? There are many types of mental health disorders and each manifests differently. Some of these include depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, and autism. There are more than 10 types of mental disorders and can affect daily living and others can be long-lasting. These conditions affect your thinking, behaviour, mood, and feelings. Who is at risk for mental disorders? Mental illnesses do not discriminate, and anyone can develop a mental health disorder. However, there are certain conditions that can increase one’s predisposition to developing a mental illness. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in America estimates that 21% of all U. S adults suffer some form of a mental illness, females at a higher risk than males. These conditions were most prevalent in young adults compared to the 26-49 year and older age groups. Those at higher risk to develop a mental illness are identified by: Genetics Discrimination and social/racial injustices Alcohol and drug user Stressful life events including negative life experiences and traumas Financial problems Myth vs Fact What is fact? What is the impact of mental health on the workforce? As more research and investment is made into mental health, we’ll outline and bust five mental health myths in order to create a more informed, open, inclusive and empathic work environment for all. Myth: Individuals with mental health challenges cannot hold down a job or do it effectively. Fact: Mental health symptoms manifest different depending on the individual and the exact nature of the condition. While it’s true it can affect one’s ability to work, it could also not have any effect or negative impact at all. If they are high-functioning individuals, they can function in their day-to-day lives without a drop in their productivity or work attendance despite their internal struggles. Myth: Talking about my mental health issues at work will affect my growth at work. Fact: Individuals with mental health conditions can work. When the condition is managed and its treatment plan is followed, they can work as well as any other employee. Myth: Mental health cannot be improved in the workplace. Fact: Employee wellness plays a big role in the health and productivity of employees. By creating a caring company culture and offering a safe, support system to employees can result in positive outcomes. Organisations can hold information sessions, direct employees to treatment centres and not ostracise struggling employees. Myth: Struggling with mental health issues means you are weak. Fact: According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), depression is the most common mental disorder globally, affecting more 260 million people. This is not a sign of weakness, nor is it an indicator of a lack of willpower. Anyone can develop a mental health condition because factors like genetics, chemical imbalances and social stressors can contribute to its development. Myth: Individuals with mental health conditions are violent and can be dangerous. Fact: Despite the portrayal in the media of those struggling with mental health as being violent, this is rarely true. This is misinformation which perpetuates the stigmas around mental health. Responses to mental health The American Psychiatric Association Foundation developed a “Notice. Talk. Act.” approach for the workplace that can help staff understand and learn about mental health issues. Notice: If HR or any colleague notices a behavioural or performance changes in a co-worker which can be indicative of burnout and depression. They can approach them privately to find out if something is wrong. Talk. Speak privately with the struggling employee and show your care and concern for their challenge. Talk to them without judgement but with care, an open mind and a desire to know and understand things from their point of view. When people feel heard in a safe space, they are encouraged to be more open to hear advice and receive help. Act. Make available employee assistance programs for staff and encourage those struggling to get help and direct them where they can get help and improve their mental health. Organisations can implement employee wellness initiatives that cater both the physical and mental health wellbeing of their employees. Alison offers a range of free courses teaching on the different types of mental disorders that they can encourage their staff to sign up for. These will inform their staff on how to support individuals with mental illness and equip them on how to manage stress and anxiety in the workplace. If you’re unsure about how you’re really doing, take our Mental Health & Wellbeing Assessment, developed by world leading psychometric professionals, to assess and begin your journey to overall wellness. Inroads are being made when it comes to the education and treatment of individuals living with mental health disorders. Because it’s so far-reaching in its effects and areas of impact, mental health cannot be treated in isolation. By busting these myths and the facts laid bare, workplaces can develop an integrated and holistic support system to its employees.","length":6030,"tokens":1156,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Busted: 5 Mental Health Myths Debunked","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/busted-5-mental-health-myths-debunked","essay_date":"Jun 7, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"We all experience stress at some point in our lives.

Does work sometimes leave you feeling intensely demotivated and overwhelmed? Answered yes to any of these questions? You could be heading toward burnout. We recommend you continue reading to discover how learning more about yourself can help prevent burnout. What is Burnout and What are the Warning Signs? What is burnout? According to the Oxford Dictionary, burnout can be defined as “physical or mental collapse caused by overwork or stress” and according to a recent survey by Indeed, many people are feeling the pressure. The report shows that 52% of all workers are feeling burned out, up +9% from pre-pandemic times. What Are the Warning Signs of Burnout? Apart from the obvious symptoms like exhaustion and anxiety, burnout can present itself in many shapes and forms. Understanding the symptoms and knowing what to look out for can help prevent you from burning out. 7 signs you may be experiencing burnout at work: You are constantly tired and can’t seem to get enough sleep! Even if you go to bed at a decent time, you wake up feeling exhausted. This symptom of burnout typically goes hand-in-hand with waking up feeling anxious and on high alert. Low motivation. You just can’t get into the swing of things. Even if you know exactly what you need to do to get through your day, it feels like you can’t find the motivation to start ticking off items on your task list. Decreased productivity. You’re used to operating at a certain level of efficiency, but lately, you’ve noticed that even the simplest of tasks take longer than expected to complete. Lack of creativity and general brainpower. You find it difficult to generate new ideas, find solutions to problems and in general, think creatively. A change in your mood. You’re not feeling like your usual sunny self. You’re feeling anxious. Anxiety can show up in different ways and may be related to something more serious. If your job or work environment triggers your anxiety we recommend speaking to your direct manager or seeking professional help. Panic attacks. Just like with anxiety, this is a massive red flag and should set off all of your warning signs that something is not right. How to Stop Yourself from Getting Burnout Prevention is the best cure! The easiest way to prevent burnout is by nipping it in the bud and self-awareness is the best way to go about it. Check Up on Your Mental Wellbeing You know yourself better than anyone else. The first step in keeping burnout at bay is to check in with yourself. How are you coping at work? Are you feeling stressed out? Are you getting enough sleep? How are your anxiety levels? If just the mere thought of these questions gets your heart racing, it might be worth taking a closer look at your mental wellbeing. Our free mental wellness assessment allows you to identify your wellbeing strengths and growth potential, assess your personal wellbeing drivers and equip you with actionable insights into your mental health. Self-awareness is incredibly powerful and can help you manage stressful situations and a highly demanding job with a seemingly never-ending to-do list. We’ve developed the test in partnership with Welliba, a leader in workplace psychometrics. The short assessment helps you to understand what drives you and how you can fuel your positivity and confidence levels. Is Your Current Job the Right Fit for You? The reason why you’re not coping at work might be because you’re following the wrong career path. Think about it; if the thought of speaking in front of people terrifies you, you might not be the best person for a job in sales, but perhaps that’s the career path you’re following. So – what is the link between work satisfaction and burnout? A study conducted to determine the relationship between burnout syndrome and job satisfaction among mental health workers found that “the highest degree of correlation was found between emotional exhaustion and pay and rewards dissatisfaction, which indicates that workers who are less satisfied with their pay and rewards report a higher degree of emotional exhaustion.” Just like with your mental health, empowerment starts from within. A personality test, like our free Workplace Personality Assessment, can help you determine your natural strengths and weaknesses and give you insight into why you do the things you do. The test will also tell you which jobs you will be naturally good at. A job matched to your strengths and weaknesses will in return lead to higher job satisfaction and lower your chances of getting burnout. 6 Ways to Prevent Burnout Speak up. If you’re feeling the pressure, let someone know! Ask for help. Take a break – especially if you work in front of a screen for most of the day. Power up with a healthy diet. Keep your stress levels low by exercising. Switch off during non-working hours. Self-knowledge is key – knowing your own limits and personal drivers is vital in fighting off burnout. Remember that you are only human and even if we would all like to have them, you don’t have superpowers.","length":5207,"tokens":1085,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Keeping Burnout at Bay – How Knowing Yourself can Help.","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/knowing-yourself-can-prevent-burnout","essay_date":"May 20, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Have you ever felt like you’re carrying the world on your shoulders and that no matter what you do and how hard you work, you just can’t seem to get ahead of your daily to-do list?

Our Founder and CEO, Mike Feerick, shares his vision for the company which has over 23 million learners, 4 million graduates and more than 4,000 courses and is having a positive impact on millions of lives across Africa. MOOCs are having a moment, thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic. Massive Open Online Course platforms, like Alison, are breaking through the frontiers of education as we’ve always known it and creating a completely new landscape. In our case, that means empowering millions of learners worldwide to improve their lives through education – for free. As you may know, we are a for-profit social enterprise founded by Mike in 2007. Mike, who is a keynote speaker at the conference, is as full of pioneering zeal as he was when he first launched Alison in Galway, Ireland. His vision for a platform where education is accessible to anyone, anywhere, any time, remains as revolutionary as ever. To date, over 23 million learners, including 7 million in Africa, have enjoyed equal access to education and skills development for free on our platform. “If you are going to spend your professional life doing something, it’s most exciting if there is real soul to what you do and enabling and empowering people still excites me,” he said. “The big picture is addressing the issue of physical poverty worldwide. There is no doubt, if you make education freely available to everyone that basic levels of physical poverty can be addressed.” In Alison’s case, that means providing a swathe of courses teaching everything from basic English to university standard courses along with practical, skills-based subjects and trades. This year, we have teamed up with the Mobile Education Alliance to create courses to support digital literacy in Africa and beyond. “Only 8% of the world’s population have ever gone to traditional college. It is no wonder that we have skill shortages across the world,” says Mike. “However, traditional college is too slow, expensive and out of date today. People need to learn now, and they can. We at Alison can empower anyone at any time to learn valuable skills for the workplace for free, to enable them to get employment, be promoted, or start their own businesses. Education is no longer the domain of the wealthy, it is open to all, once you have the motivation and determination to spend the time learning. Improving digital literacy skill is one of the first steps in this journey.” Meet the Alison Team in Africa Mike is looking forward to his visit to Rwanda and is planning a road trip through Eastern Africa doing one of his favourite things – meeting Alison learners! “Over four weeks, I will be travelling by road across Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania. My goal is to hear as many stories as possible from Alison graduates about how they came to Alison, what they studied, and how free study helped empower them in the workplace or through personal development. I want to listen to their advice on how we might develop Alison services further, to assist them further in their careers, and also assist those in their community to upskill and develop themselves through our free online services. Hundreds of Alison graduates have responded to our call. I’ll endeavour to meet as many as possible, as I did on previous trips to Nigeria and South Africa.” He is also interested in meeting with local educators, trainers, and policymakers relating to workplace skills training and empowerment. The Alison team, including members from Africa and Ireland, will also be running workshops during the eLearning Africa conference in Kigali and are excited about meeting learners, instructors, schools and businesses and discussing the Diploma and Certificate courses, career development tools, how you can earn and learn with Alison or how you can empower your business. If it’s anything like his recent trip to meet Alison’s team members and learners in Pakistan, there will be many new connections to celebrate. “What amazes me about going to countries like Pakistan is how many bright and highly motivated people there are all around the world. As a wise person once said, talent is everywhere, it is just that opportunity is not. Alison is working on breaking down these barriers to opportunity,” Feerick added. Empowering Millions from Across Continents While our HQ remains in Ireland, we now employ more than 200 people across Africa, India, Pakistan, Europe and the USA who look after the technological needs of the platform, monitor standards, market the courses and so on. The courses are provided by subject matter experts who can choose to self-publish or take the assisted publisher route and pay a small fee to have their course created in-house. In each case, our team curate the courses, making sure that they are well-structured pedagogically and adhere to our high standards. We also provide marketing support. While there are courses from major establishments, such as Stanford and Cambridge, among the 4,000 plus available on the platform, ex-Harvard man Mike believes in empowering individuals to step up and share their expertise too. “There must be millions of subject matter experts in the world who would love to create a course and tap into an income stream,” he says. While traditional education is a slow-moving beast, in the world of eLearning, nothing stays the same for long. This past year has seen a number of exciting developments at Alison! We launched our app in May 2021 and have rapidly clocked up well over one million users and a 4.8-star rating. We also launched an app for our Workplace Personality Assessment. This popular psychometric test has been completed by over 100,000 users. More recently, we have also teamed up with healthcare provider Welliba to host the Welliba Workplace Wellbeing Assessment. Finally, just last month, our entire platform was rebranded and now boasts a streamlined, easy to navigate experience. The focus on empowerment is reflected in the strong careers guidance on our platform, and new features in development include a resume builder, to further support learners to progress in their chosen field, and hubs where our learners can easily navigate interconnected courses and find out more about a given subject or get inspiration for new directions. While it is gratifying to run a successful and growing business, Mike never loses sight of his vision of empowering people to achieve their full potential. Our YouTube channel is peppered with comments testifying to the difference our platform is making in the lives of people like musician Godfrey Ssentongo who wrote: “You’ve really helped us who lost our parents at 3yrs and couldn’t have any qualifications if it wasn’t for your initiative.” Stay up to date with the Alison team’s travels through Eastern Africa as they meet learners along the way.

With so many career paths to choose from, it’s easy to become overwhelmed – and post people do! If you don’t know what you want to do as a job, the task may seem impossible. Even with thousands of Certificate and Diploma courses to choose from at Alison, we know you’ll need a little help in selecting the right ones for your career path. No matter what stage of your career you are at, with guidance, organisation, and knowing your strengths, making the right career choice won’t seem scary. The Alison Career Guide As you all know by now, here at Alison, we are all about 100% free education, with 24 million Learners over 15 years. We also know that learning without a clear objective in mind (unless you’re into it, in which case we say, awesome!), doesn’t yield the best results when studying towards a career goal. Thankfully, we have a solution. The Alison Career Guide will help you make the right decisions when it comes to deciding which career path you would like to pursue. Our career guide gives you access to everything you need to know about hundreds of career options – and on top of that, we will recommend the skills you need to be successful in any of these careers and give you access to free courses you can take to develop these skills. Find Out Who You Truly Are Before you can choose the right career, you must learn about yourself. Your values, interests, soft skills, and aptitudes, combined with your personality type, make some occupations a good fit for you and others completely inappropriate. Use a self-assessment tool, such as our free Workplace Personality Test to learn more about your natural strengths and weaknesses and receive a personalised list of jobs that may be a good fit for you. Make a List of Occupations to Explore You probably have lots of potential career paths in front of you, keep yourself organised, and combine them into one list. Title it “Jobs to Explore.” Your self-assessment will have ​indicated that these options are a good fit for you based on several of your traits, so they’re worth exploring. Next, find the occupations on your lists that appeal to you. They may be careers you know a bit about and want to explore further. Also, include professions about which you don’t know much. You might learn something unexpected. Explore the Occupations on Your List & Narrow Them Down Once you’ve managed to narrow down your list, you can get more information about each of the occupations on your list. Head on over to our career guide where you will find vital information that will help you decide which career to pursue. Get more information about: Typical job responsibilities Standard work environment Recommended job skills (plus free course recommendations!) Suggested work experience Recommended qualifications Projected career map Now that you have the information, narrow down your list even further. Begin eliminating the occupations you don’t want to pursue based on what you learned from your research using our career guide. If the reasons for you not wanting to pursue a particular job are non-negotiable, check it off your list. Remove everything that has tasks that you don’t want to do. Careers with poor employment prospects should be avoided. Remove yourself from any career if you are unable or unwilling to meet the educational or other standards, or if you lack any of the soft skills required to succeed in it. Set Your Goals & Action Plan Once you’ve made a decision, define your long term and short term goals. This assists in planning a path toward finally getting a job in your desired area. Long-term goals normally take three to five years to accomplish, but short-term goals may usually be completed in six months to three years. Allow your research on necessary education and training to serve as a guide. Do extra research if you don’t have all of the information. Set your goals when you’ve gathered all of the necessary information. Completing your education and training is an example of a long-term goal. Applying to college, apprenticeships, other training programmes, and internships are all short-term objectives. Create a career action plan, which is a written plan that lists all of the actions you will need to do to achieve your goals. Consider it a road map that will take you from point A to point B. List your short and long term goals, as well as the steps you’ll need to take to achieve each one. Include any potential roadblocks to reaching your goals, as well as plans to overcome them. This may appear to be a lot of work—and it is. However, it is much easier to carve out a professional path when you know what you want. Taking these actions now can save you a lot of trouble and confusion later on. Make Your Career Choice Finally, after completing all of your research, you are most probably ready to start choosing a career that is right for you and go about landing your dream job. Based on your research, choose the career that you believe will provide you with the most satisfaction. Remember that you have the right to a second chance if you change your mind about a decision at any time in your life. Many people change jobs at least a few times throughout their lives, so don’t feel bad if the one you are currently in isn’t the right one for you.","length":5421,"tokens":1140,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Find a Career that is Right for You","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/find-a-career-that-is-right-for-you","essay_date":"Mar 31, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Finding a career that is right for you is no small task, whether you are just starting out, looking for a change or returning to work after being away.

It might surprise you that nearly one in seven people worldwide suffer from mental health issues. With the advent of COVID-19 and remote working, and the strain placed on people returning to work after isolation and loss, looking after one’s mental health in the workplace is more important than ever before. Being the best you can be in the workplace starts with one simple step. According to this study by the CDC in America, mental health does not only affect our minds and moods in the workplace. Poor mental wellbeing also has physical effects. The most significant and detrimental consequences of not looking after your mental state at work are: Low productivity and performance Not being able to focus on tasks Lack of communication with colleagues Not being able to function physically Welliba & Alison Alison has partnered with Welliba, a digital platform committed to understanding and improving mental wellbeing in the workplace through psychometric testing. They believe that addressing the core issues of poor mental health at a company can improve employees’ physical, psychological and emotional well-being. Making these changes leads to a positive, productive and overall better environment. In collaboration with Welliba, we’ve designed the Mental Health & Wellbeing Check-up, a free psychometric test that allows you to measure your emotional and physical wellbeing at work. Using the latest technology, you will be able to analyse and identify your strengths and the areas you need to work on. The first step to starting your mental health journey is having all of the information to hand. Our well-being test will take the guesswork out of how to get started caring for your well-being with a short assessment. A Look at How Welliba and Alison Can Help You Looking after your mental health at work is a pretty broad topic. We caught up with Lena, one of Welliba’s product experts to talk about the importance of mental health at work and how our Mental Health & Wellbeing Check-up can improve your work-life. Why is it important for employees to look after their mental health? “On the preventative side, looking after their mental health prevents them from developing mental illness. Often, the first symptoms of mental illness appear years before the actual diagnosis, so they often go unnoticed. Therefore, detecting an emerging mental illness early on is highly desirable before becoming chronic. Mental health is a goal: It feels good to be mentally healthy! There are more positive emotions and more enjoyment in your activities, both at work and in your personal life. On the growth side, we know that mental health is connected to many positive and desirable outcomes: better physical health (mental and physical health are closely related), better relationships, more success in one’s career, better resilience in times of adversity and higher levels of creativity.” Should businesses invest in their workforces’ mental well-being? “Absolutely. 61% of employees feel that their mental health negatively impacts their performance, and 81% of employees believe that businesses should enable a superior employee experience. Employee wellbeing does/should not only address how a person is feeling and whether they are generally happy, but also whether they have the personal resources to realise their full potential and achieve their personal and professional goals. In return, wellbeing impacts sick leave, performance, productivity, engagement, learning agility etc.” How can businesses look after their employees’ mental health? “Businesses should empower employees to understand wellbeing, reflect on their wellbeing, and provide actionable and on-demand insights to plan their journey. They can do this by providing the workforce with the tools to get self-insight – most employees have limited self-insight – and by understanding which interventions are needed on a company level, and offer these specific interventions (instead of just some kind of intervention, not knowing whether it addresses any needs present in the workforce). This enables employees to take control and, at the same time, provides them with guidance, support and resources to act on their personal needs.” How does the Mental Health & Wellness Checkup Work? “The user answers questions on the different aspects of wellbeing and gets personalised feedback. This feedback provides a snapshot of the current wellbeing status of a person – the perfect start to kick off a wellbeing journey, getting hints and pointers on what aspects would have the most significant impact on the overall wellbeing of a person. It is a tool for self-reflection that provides reliable, science-backed insights into the concept of wellbeing, explaining the relevant aspects of personal and work wellbeing. It also offers actionable insights and tips on where and how to start an individual wellbeing journey.” What is workplace psychometric testing? “It means assessing various characteristics of employees working in an organisation. This can, for example, be personality, cognitive ability (intelligence), motivation or wellbeing. The goal is to determine who would be the best fit for a particular job within the organisation for both external recruitment and internal promotion. For this, we usually measure cognitive ability and personality. Another goal is to determine which interventions would be appropriate for which employee. For example, who needs which kind of training, workshop, coaching, etc. We can look at ability, personality, motivation and wellbeing. Good quality psychometric tests are developed on a sound scientific basis and evaluated according to predefined quality criteria.” How does Welliba use psychometric testing to determine a person’s mental wellbeing? “We have a science-based model of wellbeing and developed a questionnaire assessing the aspects of this model. The wellbeing model looks at to what extent the person feels happy and good, but also at factors like meaning and purpose in life or quality of relationships. The person answers questions on mood, sense of meaning, purpose or relationship quality. Based on this, we can provide the person with feedback on where they are on the different aspects of wellbeing and their overall wellbeing. Additionally, ideas on maintaining an already high level of wellbeing and improving areas that are not quite as strong yet are presented.” In what ways can employees improve their mental health at work? “Many internal factors impact wellbeing at work. How a person approaches situations and tasks, generates opportunities, utilises strengths, activates personal resources, deals with setbacks etc., are fundamental for wellbeing. The more a person is aware of their preferences, behavioural tendencies, motives, and abilities, the better they can address situations, shape their learning and development, and ultimately improve their wellbeing at work and in life.” The Alison Mental Health & Wellness Test Alison is committed not just to free learning but to ensuring our Learners make the most of their studies and futures.

With the advent of COVID-19 and remote working, and the strain placed on people returning to work after isolation and loss, looking after one’s mental health in the workplace is more important than ever before. Being the best you can be in the workplace starts with one simple step. According to this study by the CDC in America, mental health does not only affect our minds and moods in the workplace. Poor mental wellbeing also has physical effects.

Why is it important for employees to look after their mental health? “On the preventative side, looking after their mental health prevents them from developing mental illness. Often, the first symptoms of mental illness appear years before the actual diagnosis, so they often go unnoticed. Therefore, detecting an emerging mental illness early on is highly desirable before becoming chronic. Mental health is a goal: It feels good to be mentally healthy!

They can do this by providing the workforce with the tools to get self-insight – most employees have limited self-insight – and by understanding which interventions are needed on a company level, and offer these specific interventions (instead of just some kind of intervention, not knowing whether it addresses any needs present in the workforce) This enables employees to take control and, at the same time, provides them with guidance, support and resources to act on their personal needs.” How does the Mental Health & Wellness Checkup Work? “The user answers questions on the different aspects of wellbeing and gets personalised feedback.","content_length":967,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Looking After Your Mental Health At Work","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/looking-after-your-mental-health-at-work","essay_date":"Mar 30, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"This feedback provides a snapshot of the current wellbeing status of a person – the perfect start to kick off a wellbeing journey, getting hints and pointers on what aspects would have the most significant impact on the overall wellbeing of a person.

As part of our commitment to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, we celebrate World Water Day today. World Water Day is observed and celebrated every on the 22nd of March, to raise awareness of people living without access to safe water. And to motivate people to take action to achieve clean water and sanitation for all by 2030, which is Sustainable Development Goal 6. Combining awareness and education, we can create communities worldwide that are far more sustainable. See how Alison incorporates each of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals into our mission statement. In honour of World Water Day, we’d like to introduce this year’s theme, “Groundwater – Making the Invisible Visible.” and how you can make a difference. Even the tiniest actions can lead to massive changes. “I have found that it is the small everyday deed of ordinary folks that keep the darkness at bay. Small acts of kindness and love.” ~ Gandalf (J. R. R. Tolkien ~ The Hobbit)” UN World Water Development Report 2022 On March 21, 2022, at the opening ceremony of the 9th World Water Forum in Dakar, Senegal, the UN World Water Development Report 2022 “Groundwater – Making the Invisible Visible” was released. The theme for significant events and campaign actions throughout the year is set by the report and the conclusions of the report provide suggestions for governments all across the world. Ground Water for World Water Day 2022 Groundwater is invisible, but its impact is visible everywhere-The water we drink, use to grow our food and helps replenish our lakes and rivers. In the driest parts of the world, it may be the only water people have. Almost all of the liquid freshwater in the world is groundwater, supporting drinking water supplies, sanitation systems, farming, industry and ecosystems. While some groundwater contaminants are naturally occurring, unfortunately, most groundwater contamination is the result of human activity. In many places, human activities over-use and pollute groundwater. In other places, we simply do not know how much water is down there. What is Groundwater? Water covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface, but just 1% of that water is readily available for human use. Of that 1% of usable water, 99% is buried beneath our feet as groundwater. Water found underground in aquifers is known as groundwater. Gravel, sand, sandstone, or broken rock make up aquifers. The size of the gaps in the soil or rock determines the speed of groundwater movement. Groundwater is almost everywhere. Depending on many factors, the water table may be deep or shallow and may rise or fall. Heavy rains or melting snow may cause the water table to rise. Heavy pumping of groundwater reserves may cause the water table to drop. Why We Should Care About Groundwater We all rely on groundwater in some way. Therefore we need to study and protect it before it’s too late. Groundwater is being over-used in many locations. With more water extracted from aquifers than replenished by rain and snow. Groundwater contamination is a problem that might take decades, if not centuries, to remedy. We don’t know how much groundwater is beneath our feet in specific locations, which means we might be wasting a valuable water resource. What Must We Do About Groundwater? We must prevent groundwater from being contaminated and use it responsibly. While balancing people’s and the planet’s requirements. The importance of groundwater in sanitation systems, farming, industry, ecosystems, and climate change adaptation must be acknowledged in sustainable development planning. Studying, preserving, and harnessing groundwater sustainably, will be fundamental to surviving and responding to climate change and satisfying the needs of a growing population. Adapting to Climate Change With Groundwater The UN aims to turn the 2020s into a decade of climate action and support, so it can be “at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.” Groundwater will play a critical role in adapting to climate change. We need to work together to sustainably manage this precious element that brings life. At Alison, our Climate Change Hub offers you courses designed to help you a better understanding of climate change, its effects and how it can be combated. Preserving our planet for future generations. How You Can Make A Difference Knowing the facts of climate change and the science behind what’s going on with the health of the environment is crucial. As you probably know by now, Alison feels that education should be free and accessible to everyone, everywhere. You can examine how with water treatment technologies and their applications, such as producing usable water from wastewater with treatment units, systems, re-use and recycling.

Not only in our home office, but with all of you around the world. For those of you who aren’t quite sure what all the fuss and green beer are about every year. Today, we want to show you just how much there is to learn about The Emerald Isle and its rich heritage. From history to food and drink and especially music. It’s not all Riverdance and U2, and I can’t talk about the music of Ireland on St. Patrick’s Day without mentioning The Cranberries. I digress. Today, we are exploring traditional instruments and how you can master them with Alison. Now, join us as we celebrate with good friends, a whiskey or beer in hand, and lots of good music! A Quick Historical Interlude The origin of St. Patrick’s Day celebrations goes back more than 1,500 years to the 17th century, when the earliest known ones were held on March 17, commemoration the anniversary of the death of St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, in the 5th century. Also known as the Feast of Saint Patrick, that marked the arrival of Christianity in Ireland. The holiday has evolved into a celebration of Irish culture with parades, attending a céilí, which are traditional Irish gathering , special foods, folk music, dancing, drinking, particularly Irish whiskey and beer, and a LOT of green. The colour green being part of the Irish flag, the shamrock, the three-leaf clover symbol of Ireland and of course, the country’s nickname: The Emerald Isle. Have you ever felt that you have a bit of the Luck of the Irish? You like the band Flogging Molly way more that you feel you should? Odds are you may have a little of the Emerald Isle in your family history. Learn how to research your Irish genealogy for free, and you may just be surprised to find out that your love of Guinness is genetic! With this course you will learn how to trace your Irish family history and what resources you can use to find out more about it, all from an Irish perspective. Learn The Music of Ireland this St. Patrick’s Day The musician Tomás Ó Canainn once said: “no aspect of Irish music can be fully understood without a deep appreciation of sean-nós singing. It is the key which opens every lock.” Traditional Sean-nós singing is performed in Gaelic without the backing of instruments and is known for its melodic and expressive beauty. The term sean-nós, translates to “in the old way” and what better way to get you started with tthe Music of Ireland on St. Patrick’s Day. When people think about Irish music, one of the first instruments that come to mind is the fiddle. This is for good reason, Celtic traditional fiddle playing has passed down through the generations over many centuries. With our course on how you can learn the fundamentals of Irish fiddle playing, online for free. Your instructor, Doireann Ní Ghlacáin, is a professional musician and the face of Irish TV station TG4’s live music coverage channel. For our final instrument in this post, we are going to bring in the percussion section. Introducing, the Bodhrán (pronounced bow-ron), a corner stone of traditional Irish folk music. With this course, you will learn the fundamentals of playing the Bodhrán. Put in the practice and you will be well on your way to drumming along to reels and rhythms accompanied by fiddles, accordions, tin-whistles and more.

Making the change is something that anyone can do, regardless of how long you’ve been in your particular industry or what your industry is. All it takes is the will to do it.

We can achieve women’s equality by working together. International Women’s Day is also a call to action for equality for women across all aspects of life. No matter if it’s at home, the workplace, government or just being out in public. Women deserve to be respected and appreciated for everything they do. In honour of International Women’s Day, Alison would want to pay tribute to all the fantastic ladies out there and share some of their success stories. At Alison, two of the pillars we are founded on are especially relevant to International Women’s Day. Celebrating International Women’s Day with Empowerment. At Alison one of the ways how we strive to better women’s lives is through empowerment.

We strongly believe in the power of free education and skills training to change people’s lives for the better and are passionate about providing a learning experience that meets all their needs and helps them to achieve their life goals After all, knowledge is power.

With free education and training open to all, we really think that every woman has the ability to grow, attain her goals, and ultimately enhance her life. Everyone, regardless of race, gender, or culture, has the right to a free education. This is particularly true for females. Women used to be denied access to school, but that is no longer the case, and as a result, women are transforming the world. We hope to use Alison’s technology, skills, and innovative approach to enable women all over the world make their mark in whatever profession they choose. Let us introduce you to a few women who have gained confidence and obtained the respect and positions they deserve as a result of their studies. They have altered their life as a result of the skills, self-improvement, and information they have obtained. Ogala Amina Maneti Ogala Amina Maneti has a qualification in Public Administration and began taking Alison classes in 2013. Amina has completed courses in Customer Service, Procurement and Human Resources such as Fundamentals of Corporate Management. She enjoys that Alison’s courses are self-paced with no deadline for completion. Alison has given her the confidence, power, and edge when applying for a variety of jobs.

Morgan Ballou In her video testimony, Morgan tells us she was a high school dropout. She started looking into online learning to further her education and make her way into the work force. Through Alison, she completed courses in C-Programming, Trademarks and Copyright, and Investment. She and Investment has also completed a Diploma in Legal Studies and a Diploma in Psychology. Alison has helped her gain the skills needed to earn her way into Harvard’s HBX online learning initiative and her current position with the Legal Association of Professionals. Oluyemisi Onyegbula Oluyemisi Onyegbula works as an online coordinator and sales trainer for Multipro, a Lagos-based Nigerian company. She discovered Alison when she started her current job.

Thanks to these free courses, she became an asset at Multipro and we wish her many more years of success. Now those are what we call success stories!

Getting the best out of each day can be nearly impossible if you’re not in the right frame of mind. Ideally, you want to be positive, well-rested, feeling good and ready to Carpe that Diem. We’ve all heard the saying that small things can make a big difference. We tend to get caught up in the big picture and overlook the little things that make it up. So instead of focusing on how you can change the world, we’re going to focus on how you can implement small changes at home that will alter how you view and interact with the world around you. Here are a few easy ones to get you started on your journey to making the most out of every day. Make Your Bed Once you’ve surfaced from your slumber, make your bed! It sounds silly, I know, but rather than waiting until after your coffee, brushing your teeth, and so on, just do it. Let me tell you why: Studies have shown that making your bed first is accomplishing and completing an objective. This leads to a sense of pride, and the urge to accomplish more tasks snowballs throughout the day, which feels pretty good each time you do it. See, you’re already making disciplined, productive decisions. Here is how you can discover the importance of daily self-discipline. Enjoy The Little Things This brings me to my next point. Nothing is trivial; the little things can mean so much, just like making the bed. Without getting the little things right first, getting the big things right is impossible. Make a list of the things that you think you don’t have time for, the things that you keep putting off around the house. Do them and you’ll instantly feel better. A great way to do this is by getting your space organised. By space, I don’t just mean the garage that’s overflowing with stuff you never seem to get around to throwing away. Organise your finances. Start a journal to organise your thoughts. Plan your meals. There are so many ways to declutter both your mind and your surroundings. Now that your mind has been decluttered, a great way to de-stress and be mindful is through meditation. This is leading up to you appreciating what you have around you and what you have accomplished. Which in turn will start to affect those around you. The good vibes just keep on coming, don’t they? Be Kind To Yourself Self-care is often overlooked. A positive attitude can only be achieved by having a positive view of yourself. Do yourself a favour and take some “me time” every day to be with yourself and recharge your batteries. Here’s a self-care blog to give you some more tips on how to show yourself some kindness. A Healthy Mind Needs A Healthy Body Sleep, diet, and exercise. You hear about them all the time. There’s a reason for that; they work! Your stress levels go down, you’re more alert, you make better decisions, you’re a better you. I’m not saying you must work out for 3 hours a day, only eat boiled chicken, broccoli, and kale, and be in bed by 8 pm every night. Remember, we were talking about the little things. Moderation is the key. Go for a walk or run around the neighbourhood, do a few situps and pushups. A little cardio and a few bodyweight workouts will go a long way. Have a look at how you can develop and stick to your own workout plan. Instead of processed sugars and carbs, go for natural sweeteners and whole grains, and up your veggie intake. Take one of these courses on diet and nutrition to help you ditch junk food. Nothing frightening here, just a few small changes at home that will lead to big results as you become healthier, more productive, and ultimately happier at work. Lastly, and possibly most importantly, instead of constantly looking to the future, be present in the now. You may just surprise yourself.","length":3889,"tokens":884,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Making A Few Small Changes At Home That Lead To Big Changes At Work","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/making-a-few-small-changes-at-home-that-lead-to-big-changes-at-work","essay_date":"Feb 25, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"We all do our best to try and manage our work lives every day, but it’s a fast-paced, at times chaotic world out there, and we’re not always prepared for what it can throw at us.

Let’s have a look at what a returnship is and how Alison can help you develop those personal skills and get back to work better than ever! What Is A Returnship? Starting with the obvious, what is a returnship? Doesn’t it rhyme with “internship”? Well, you wouldn’t be wrong in thinking that the two are very similar.

It’s all about promoting and preserving linguistic and cultural diversity. The day was first announced back in 1999 by the United Nations and has been celebrated every year since. Here at Alison, we are all about language and diversity. So let’s explore a few mother tongues you can learn for free in our Language Category. So, whether you are just starting out and want to learn a new language to challenge yourself or are a professional who wants to upskill themselves and make that CV even more impressive, Alison has the right course for you. Let’s get things started with one of the widest spoken mother tongues on the globe, English. It’s spoken by over a billion people as either a first or second language. Many aspects of English can be confusing to someone who isn’t familiar with it, so starting off with the basics and working your way up to fluency is the right way to go. Look at this article on the Alison Blog about our English Vertical and the different courses available. For those of you who are already pretty good at the language, we offer a Diploma in English Language & Literature. This course is designed as a deep dive into the complexities and nuances (see, you’re learning fancy words already) of the language and the literature it is famous for. In addition, you’ll have interesting things to say at dinner parties. Languages Of The World Speaking of dinner, let’s take a trip to the land that literally came up with the word cuisine. I’m talking about France of course. Widely considered the language of love and romance, the French language isn’t all sensual sounding phrases, and delicious words, it is one of the most useful languages to learn. It can open all sorts of doors for the fluent French speaker internationally. Head on over and sign up for the Diploma in French Language Studies. Sprechen Sie German? You’ll have to excuse the butchery of the language, but it did catch your attention, right? German is one of the most widely spoken languages in the EU and is even one of the mother tongues of Namibia, all the way down in Southern Africa. Once you have mastered the basics of the German language, including how to order a Pilsner, the national drink of Germany you can move on to becoming fluent in it and using it to advance your European career goals. If French is the language of love, then Spanish is the language of passion! It conjures up images of flamenco dancers dancing to wild and vibrant music, played by mariachis on cobbled streets. From Madrid to Buenos Ares, Spanish is the fourth most spoken language in the world. This isn’t surprising as it is the official mother tongue for over 20 countries. Take the Introduction to Spanish today! Lastly, on the subject of learning to speak different languages, there is one that isn’t spoken, sign language. Many Learners are taking this course not just to communicate with loved ones who are deaf, but because of the employment opportunities that come with being able to sign. Whether in broadcasting, the culture industry, or state communication, there are many areas in which sign language is an essential part of connecting with the public. By learning to sign effectively, you’ll be surprised how many opportunities will become available!","length":3302,"tokens":695,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Celebrate International Mother Language Day With Free Language Courses!","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/celebrate-international-mother-language-day-with-these-free-language-courses","essay_date":"Feb 21, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"The 21st of February is International Mother Tongue Day.

It’s that time of year again, Valentine’s Day. The season of love is upon us, in all its chocolatey, heart-covered glory. When everyone is coupling up, there is one kind of love that gets overlooked: self-love. You know what I’m talking about. All too often, we focus on others and everything around us, and neglect looking after ourselves. Let’s be honest, the last few years have been a little rough, and what better way to spread the love than to treat yourself with a little self-care? I’m not talking about candy, roses, and an overly priced teddy bear. This year, in addition to getting romantic with that special person, take some time and let Alison help you give yourself the pampering you deserve with these personal development courses. Via Giphy Developing Healthy Habits. First things first, most of us don’t really know what self-care involves. We’ve heard of it, thought it was a great idea, and promptly forgotten about it as soon as something else pops up. Thankfully, we have you covered with a course on how to put a self-care list together. Take the time to reset and rejuvenate not just for yourself but for those around us. Remember, if you aren’t taking care of yourself, taking care of others can be impossible. Speaking of stress, be it work, family, or personal, managing stress in a practical way is next on our list of self-love and self-care. Taking consistent measures can greatly improve your overall wellness, and have you making the most of every day in a calm, collected way. To supplement the calm you have achieved, let’s try a little meditation too. Mindful meditation will help you be present in the moment, listen and react positively to problems, and improve relationships with those around you. Take a look at this video for a quick demonstration. A healthy mind deserves a healthy body to go with it. Fitness can serve two purposes: releasing tension and what’s better than looking in the mirror and seeing positive physical changes? Self-appreciation at its finest. Look at how to structure a workout plan to make the most out of and develop core strength and flexibility with yoga. Remember earlier when I mentioned chocolate and candy? Edible happiness, right? Turns out, there are other things to shove in your mouth that are tasty, and a whole lot better for you. We all know that our bodies and minds need fuel in the form of food, but there is a difference between the types of fuel we should be using regularly and those we should limit (most of the time anyway). Here’s a healthy living course to make sure you are firing on all cylinders. Give Yourself A Gift. Via Giphy Now that you have all you need for a healthy, mindful, and stress-free life, it’s a great time to learn something new. For example, learning how to draw. It doesn’t matter if you’re the next Michelangelo or specialize in stickmen; a new hobby is always a great way to step back and appreciate all you’ve accomplished on your self-care journey.

While the majority of our 21 million Learners engage with Alison independently as they empower themselves through self-learning, many organisations around the world use Alison as part of their own initiatives to promote accessible education. While in the UAE last month, Mike came across another fantastic example of how Alison is helping organisations around the world make a real difference through free learning. “One of the fun things I get to do as CEO of Alison is to travel the world meeting our learners wherever I go. Last month, I spoke at RewirEd 2021, an education conference in Dubai. After my talk, I was approached by Shadia Abdullah, the founder and Director of Rawafed Development & Learning Centre in Sharjah in the UAE. Shadia told me that the Rawafed Centre has been using Alison for many years. The centre educates the children of migrant workers who come to the UAE who fall out of the education system. She and her team focus on teaching these young people basic literacy skills in Arabic and English, as well as basic mathematics. This gives them a chance of to rejoin the public schooling system or enter the workforce. Shadia said that Alison was useful in training the many teachers that she has working in the school – allowing them in turn teach English and Mathematics to their students. Shadia said her teachers were delighted to hear that she had met me and so I asked her how far her school was from the conference.

The hub brings together crucial and potentially life-saving information both on how individuals can survive disasters and how organisations can better respond to and resource disaster situations. Catalyst 2030 is an organisation of social entrepreneurs united in their commitment to achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Catalyst 2030 is composed of various dedicated groups specialising in particular areas. The Disaster Management Group, chaired by Alan Braithwaite, has worked closely with Alison in creating this unique and free resource that aims to radically alter how we respond to disasters. The Alison Blog spoke to Alan about the fundamental roles that both social enterprise and education have to play in reshaping disaster relief. Hi Alan, can you tell us a bit about the aims of Catalyst 2030 and your role in the organisation? Catalyst 2030 is a movement of social entrepreneurs across the world who are coming together to try and have a significant impact on the achievement of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The proposition is that, compared to top-down government actions, social entrepreneurs on the ground can make a disproportionate difference in promoting and implementing change. Catalyst 2030 came together just two years ago and already we’ve attracted over a thousand members. We’re sponsored and funded by some of the most significant charitable foundations in the world – Ashoka, the Schwab Foundation, the Scholl Foundation, Echoing Green and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well. Catalyst 2030 is built around both geographical groups and groups who come together around various conceptual or operational issues. I’m chairing the group on Disaster Management, organised around what we’ve called the three R’s of disaster: readiness, response and recovery. We’re trying to craft and define a role for social entrepreneurs in the global system of how the world deals with disasters. There’s no question from the research that we’ve done that the way in which the world copes with disasters is broken. It’s characterised by not being as prepared for the obvious scenarios as one could be, arriving late, bringing the wrong things, leaving before people have had a chance to recover and all of the associated and well-documented questions of white colonial judgements as to what is good for people on the ground. How did this collaboration between Catalyst 2030 and Alison come about? Mike Feerick, Alison’s CEO, is a member of Catalyst and we identified very early on that there was a lack of both knowledge and access to knowledge for social entrepreneurs, agencies and authorities in terms of what needed to be done in disaster and potential disaster situations. So Mike stuck his hand up and said Alison is one of the largest online providers of educational resources and knowledge. Also, while Alison is a for-profit social enterprise, they don’t charge the ultimate user so it’s free at the point of use. And so Mike offered this amazing organisation’s capability up to the group. So Alison has created, discovered and consolidated a relevant body of knowledge into a Disaster Management Hub that is easy to access. Why is education so vital for disaster management? If you’re in a disaster, it’s likely that you’ll never have encountered one before so having the ability to access basic information on what’s happening, and what would be good or not good to do, is really important. That’s the first thing. The second thing is that we’re trying to create an organisational framework so that social entrepreneurs can be a credible resource in the disaster relief chain. We need resources and information to be made available so that social entrepreneurs, who haven’t necessarily dealt with disasters before, can pivot to help and leverage their resources. They need access to knowledge and understanding in the easiest possible way and so that’s the value in the Disaster Management Hub. How do you hope to see the Disaster Management Hub on Alison work? The Disaster Management Hub carves out a specific space for information that we can then promote easily. It will also help us to invite contributions and attract partners to the project. We’ve found that was there’s actually a lot of courses already on Alison that are extremely relevant. The hub allows us to centralise those resources and then expand them. What role do you think social enterprises can play on the ground in disaster situations? Social enterprises are generally speaking local. They’re on the ground, they’re trusted and they exist with the consent of their community. If and when disaster strikes, they’re already there. They very often have relationships with local government and therefore they’re in a position to pivot and offer support with logistics, resources and organisation much more quickly than external organisations. We know from all of the anecdotes that when disaster strikes it often takes three or four days for the big agencies to start to appear because they often spend time competing with each other for resources, rather than worrying about the people that are affected. If the people on the ground can be better organised through the capabilities of social entrepreneurs, then the international resources can be better informed and the relief will be more relevant, targeted and effective. What are the next necessary steps in setting up Catalyst 2030’S Disaster Management Group? We’ve got a clear strategic plan now and we’re in the process of creating a full-blown programme. Having formalised the training and education, we now have to devise an operating protocol so everybody knows what their role is in the future system. Alongside education we’ve obviously also got to build partnerships. We need to create an understanding as to what the information and communications technology infrastructure will be to support information flow in a disaster situation and how that can be managed. We also need to explore how we make funding available. For example, if an area is particularly prone to disasters then maybe there are things they can invest in that will both mitigate that and also produce a return. There’s a lot of experience now in impact investments and that’s something we’ve got to integrate into our operating system.","length":6400,"tokens":1252,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Alison & Catalyst 2030 launch the Disaster Management Hub","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-catalyst-2030-launch-the-disaster-management-hub","essay_date":"Jan 11, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"Alison is proud to announce the launch of the Disaster Management Hub in association with Catalyst 2030.

His remarkable story of overcoming educational challenges, from dyslexia to outdated institutional biases, is an incredible tale of perseverance, commitment and the importance of education. As if his story wasn’t inspirational enough, Iain has also beaten cancer three times and is currently taking the fight to a recent multiple sclerosis diagnosis. Iain spoke to the Alison Blog to share his incredible story in the hopes of encouraging others to never give up hope in education and to never stop fighting. Hi Iain, it’s great to get to be able to share your remarkable story. Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your journey? My name is Iain Batten and I live in South Africa. I am a single father and grandfather of two beautiful girls and three grandkids. I came into this world with a lot of difficulty! My mother was in labour for days and eventually the doctors pulled me out using steel forceps. This resulted in brain damage to the left side of my temporal lobe and cortex. I grew up in a loving Christian home, the middle of three children. Growing up, I knew I was different and I was an extremely angry person at times. I battled through school, only passing three subjects out of nine in Grade 8. I was caned by teachers every day for failing tests and I was called stupid, idiot, and other vile names by those teachers who were supposed to be teaching me. I was told that my life wouldn’t amount to much because I was stupid and couldn’t pass anything. This made me very aggressive at school. I was eventually diagnosed with severe dyslexia. At 16 years of age, I was told I had the reading average of a 10 year old. I have always had a fascination for criminology and my dream was to become a profiler or psychologist. Unfortunately, my school marks weren’t good enough for me to pursue my passion as no university, college or any other learning institute would accept the marks that I achieved. I followed the retail fashion career path, first as a trainee manager in one of the biggest retail fashion stores in South Africa. I quickly rose through the ranks and become a store manager. I went on to become an area manager in charge of thirty stores throughout South Africa. I studied through the company and I got my Sales Manager and Franchise Manager diplomas. I had spent 25 years working in the corporate environment and held the position of Operations Manager when a severe illness ripped through my body and my life. I am a very proud cancer survivor and multiple sclerosis warrior. I was born a fighter who has lived with being dyslexic and has beaten cancer. I can beat MS. Your story is truly empowering. How did Alison enter your life? I was helping a friend who was looking for an institution for her friend to learn English for free. I googled loads of institutions and came across Alison. Alison looked good and had very positive reviews, so I sent her the link. I then had a light bulb moment and decided to look into what other courses Alison offered. I was hooked from then on. What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? I have always wanted to pursue my passion for criminology and so I studied a Forensic Psychology Diploma through Austin Peay State University, Texas. I achieved a 90% average for my course over the year, which included assignments and research articles. This gave me tremendous confidence to pursue other areas of psychology. The first course I took with Alison was Introduction to Criminal Investigation: Processes, Practices and Thinking. I chose this course because I wanted to test Alison’s subject material and the course assessments and because of my interest in criminology and crime scenes. How have Alison courses affected your life? I am now onto my fourth course with Alison and I love every moment. I have been in and out of hospital having been diagnosed with a very aggressive type of skin cancer. I am no stranger to cancer, having beaten testicular cancer in 2004 and lung cancer in 2009. I have also recently been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which affects the central nervous system. It’s an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks its own healthy cells. There is no cure for multiple sclerosis but many people are able to manage their symptoms and adapt to new lifestyles after their diagnosis. The worst parts are the brain fog, depression and the constant pain. Alison courses help to keep me motivated. They allow me to be able to say I achieved something and focus a force of determination in me that drives me to get up and do the studying and to pass well! It keeps my mind off the pain I am going through. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? Definitely listening to music. It has always been my go to place when I am in pain or depressed. Getting lost in songs soothes my mind. I also enjoy walking and reading crime books. Where are you working and what are you studying now? At the present moment I am unemployed. Pre-covid I was a motivational speaker, life coach and ran a registered non-profit organisation called African Survivor Foundation. I have given cancer talks to schools, companies and churches and have taken part in survivor walks and motivated other cancer survivors to let their voices be heard as I honestly believe that that is why we were spared. To break the stigma that is still attached to the word cancer. I have been through so much in my life, including the stigma I suffered because of the cancer on my face, that I want to make a positive contribution to people going through the same thing and that’s what drives me. I have lost everything and I am currently staying with some friends in their garage, but I will never give up. I am studying everything to do with Psychology and Counselling, as this is where my passion lies. Throughout my life I have counselled many people and have had great success with it. What’s next for you, in terms of education or work? To get out of the hole I find myself in and to pursue my passion. I am in the process of setting up a website that displays my passion for psychology and criminology. I am also going to continue my work as a life coach and a motivational speaker. I am also looking at self-publishing my articles in the form of ebooks. If you could learn absolutely anything in the world from an Alison course, what would it be? More criminology courses and also theology. What would you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? Would you recommend it and why? Yes, I would highly recommend Alison to anyone who wants to upskill for a higher job position or wants to make sure they have the best skills for a new job posting and beat the competition. The way Alison courses are laid out and presented is very user friendly. It’s also nice that you can do the courses at your own pace and online. You get to choose your schedule and you can let life happen around you while you are studying.","length":6966,"tokens":1445,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Meet Iain Batten: Cancer Survivor, MS Warrior and Alison Learner","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/meet-iain-batten-cancer-survivor-ms-warrior-and-alison-learner","essay_date":"Dec 14, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Iain Batten is an Alison Learner from South Africa.

Managing customer relationships has changed drastically in recent years due to the expansion of online business. To guarantee a successful business-client relationship for you company, we’ve compiled the complete guide to Customer Relationship Management with everything you need to know! 1. Complete Guide to Writing Marketing Plans Your first interaction with your customers is when you decide on your target market. In that sense, at the very beginning of your business venture, it’s the business that chooses the customers and not the other way around. From the outset, when writing your marketing plan, it’s crucial that you correctly identify who your customer base will be so that you can gauge their expectations and build a brand that will appeal to them. 2. Sales Force Management Sales is the area that sees you engage most forcefully with your customers so it’s essential that you get the tone and pitch of your sales technique correct. Regardless of whether it’s in person or online, customers don’t want to feel like they’re the object of a hard sell. A successful sales force will result in customers thinking that the product or service for sale is something that’s essential to their lives and not something they’ve been convinced they need by a sales representative. 3. Introduction to Online Marketing Strategies The world of online marketing is a completely different ball game to the traditional world of print advertising. Online ads can be much more targeted to your desired customers, allowing you to be much more specific in your messaging. This means you can build more personalised marketing campaigns, giving you the opportunity to build a brand that resonates more directly with your client base. However, you also have to make sure you retain a broad appeal for potential new customers. 4.

Whether it’s managing online orders, fielding emails for information or staying on top of mailing lists, your online relationship with your customers is a whole world unto itself. Navigating this world successfully allows you to cut response time for any queries or questions your clients might have. 5.

There’s nothing customers hate more than being passed around from one department to another when seeking an explanation or a refund from a company. Nothing is more harmful to your brand than this. This is why an efficient and organised administration team is so fundamental to the quality of the service you can offer your customers. 6. Sales Techniques – Interacting with Customers Face to face interactions is still the most important element of a business-client relationship because customers value the human touch of good customer service and equally can get turned off by rude or inefficient staff representing your company. When interacting with customers, the two most important things to remember are to always be polite and always be fully informed about all aspects of the business so that you can answer any possible questions they may have.","length":3765,"tokens":700,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"The Complete Guide to Customer Relationship Management","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-customer-relationship-management","essay_date":"Dec 10, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"A business’ most important asset is their customer base.

The shift from coal, oil and gas towards clean energy sources is signalling the end of certain traditional energy industries. However the emerging renewable sector is producing countless opportunities for those willing and ready to adapt. Renewables produce well-paying, high-skilled and secure jobs across a range of fields. These new energy sources require technicians, mechanics, scientists, IT employees and managers in order to function efficiently. If you’re interested in a rewarding and secure career in renewable energy, then check out these courses and careers contributing to a safer and more sustainable world. 1. Worldwide Energy Sources This course is a fantastic primer for anyone looking to enter the energy industry. You’ll learn about existing sectors such as coal and oil and the traditional energy landscape. This is vital information to possess in order to be able to successfully contextualise and understand the shift towards renewables. New energy sources are considered under various headings, such as ease of access and how they affect the building industry. You’ll also gain valuable knowledge on consumption and the sociological debates around energy usage. 2. Alternative Energy Sources A fascinating course on energy alternatives, this course covers electrochemical devices and fuel cells. If you’re interesting in the technical or mechanical side of renewable energy, then this course is a must. You’ll learn about how electrical generators convert stored chemical energy into electrical current and see how supercapacitors support high energy density. This is a science heavy course for those who already know the areas in which they want to specialise. 3. Solar Energy – Solar Technology and Its Use Worldwide Despite its growing popularity, solar power technology is still relatively misunderstood. As it becomes an increasingly global energy source, skilled technicians and scientists who understand both the science and the engineering behind solar energy are going to be in high demand. This course also covers practical subjects such as the installation of solar panels on both domestic and commercial buildings. 4. An Introduction to Solar Energy Engineering As solar energy becomes more and more common, the need for technicians and engineers capable of servicing both the panels and the derivative hardware will become as established as the need for plumbers and electricians is today. Both businesses and private homes will need their solar panels installed, serviced and repaired, creating a stable and secure new market. Like these other trades, solar panel technician is a highly skilled job. Get a headstart on your competitors by beginning this course now! 5. Introduction to Wind Energy Wind turbines are becoming an increasingly common part of the world’s landscape as we harness the wind’s power to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. While the basic science of wind turbines hasn’t changed from the logic of the windmills of the past, the reality of operating or servicing a modern wind turbine is a complicated one. This course will explain both the science and the technology behind the gathering and storing of wind energy. Now head to Alison’s Career Guide to turn your new skills into exciting careers! 1.

While we all know that a mindfulness retreat or a yoga programme would be of immeasurable benefit to our daily well-being, it’s just so hard to find the time and the energy needed to make these major changes. However, there are many small changes that you can make to your daily schedule that will have a disproportionately positive effect on how you are feeling, both mentally and physically. These changes are so small that they’ve probably never even occurred to you as possibilities. By taking a few short courses on these niche health topics, you’ll gain valuable information that can transform your life by making just a few small change to your daily routine. So get learning! 1. Insomnia Solution – Sleep Better! You don’t need to be an insomniac to want to improve the quality of your sleep. Almost everyone goes through periods of sleeping badly, due to stress, changing routines or any number of other reasons. Sleeping is how the body recharges its batteries and is vital to both our physical and mental health. This course clearly explains the science of sleep and outlines some simple techniques for improving the quality of your rest. 2. Intrapersonal and Interpersonal Communication Whether at work, at home or out and about, we spend a large part of our time interacting with others. If you don’t feel at ease in yourself, or if you suffer from social anxiety, then this can be a very difficult experience. Social anxiety can result in you miscommunicating with those around you and this can result in confusion and misunderstandings. This can have repercussions both at work and socially. This course goes back to the basics of understanding yourself and builds towards how you can successfully make yourself understood with others. 3. Understanding Inflammation It’s not every day that you break your leg or suffer a concussion, but many of us will go through the day with small aches and pains that seem to come from nowhere and disappear again after a short time. These small aches are usually not painful enough to go to the doctor but they slow us down and can be more annoying than painful. These are often the results of inflammation, one of the most common causes of small scale bodily aches. By learning about inflammation you can minimise the causes and start eradicating those inconvenient niggles. 4. Ultimate Fitness System 3 – Gentle Stretching Alongside educating yourself about the causes of inflammation, learning how to correctly stretch your muscles is a simple but incredibly effective way to drastically improve the quality of your physical well being on a daily basis. Muscles shorten if they’re not regularly exercised and flexibility is reduced. If you’re working at a desk and sitting in the same position for long periods, tight muscles can start to cramp or even lead to chronic pain issues. This course will explain how you can integrate some key gentle stretching exercises into your daily routine. 5. Reiki: Third Degree Reiki is an alternative form of healing that you can use to both help others and yourself. Originating in Japan, reiki is based around restoring a correct physical and mental balance to allow for a more calm and stress-free engagement with the world around you. This fascinating course is not just a great way to increase your well-being, it will also offer you a window into the richness of traditional Japanese cultural practices and thinking.","length":3489,"tokens":702,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"5 unique & interesting courses to improve your day-to-day well being","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/5-unique-interesting-courses-to-improve-your-day-to-day-well-being","essay_date":"Nov 26, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Maintaining your mental and physical health can feel like a full-time job.

Michael McCague, the talented guitarist behind Alison’s traditional Irish guitar courses, is quoted in The Anglo-Celt newspaper on his experience of producing the courses and his love of Irish music. In the paper, which covers the northern Irish midlands, the Monaghan man spoke about how Irish music is a very welcoming community that offers friendship as well as a new skill to learners who get involved with the courses. Meanwhile in the south-west of the country, The Clare Herald covered the involvement of three Claremen in the project. Brian O’Loughlin and his brother Conor are two of the expert musicians who created courses for the project. While Brian authored both the flute and the tin whistle courses, his brother Conor produced the popular concertina courses. Another Clareman, Dermot Sheedy, of the band Hermitage Green, produced the bodhrán courses for Alison.

I am 34 years old. I was born and bred in Gokwe South District in Jange Village, Midlands Province, Zimbabwe. I did my primary schooling at Chehanga Primary School and then attended Mateta Rujeko High School. I completed my Ordinary Levels in 2006 and obtained eight ordinary level subjects. In 2008, at Advanced Level, I obtained 10 points in a combination of arts which included Literature in English, History and Divinity. My dream was to go university so I applied to several local universities. I was admitted to study but failed to pursue my studies because my family could not afford to pay for my studies as this would affect my other seven siblings’ chances of going to high school.” What did you do instead of university? After failing to go to university, I decided to look for employment so that I could fund my studies. The only kind of employment I could get was in construction. I got my first job in 2010 and it was during this time that I decided to enroll in the Occupational Safety, Health and Environmental Management Certificate offered by the National Social Security Authority of Zimbabwe. Because I was working on contract employment things were not easy. I enrolled for a Diploma in Safety, Health and Environmental Management with the Zimbabwe Institute of Management in 2012 and completed the studies in 2014. However I failed to graduate because I had debts as I was supporting my siblings. In 2020, I succeeded in obtaining my certificate. Today I am still dreaming of going to university.

I choose this course because I was working as a Safety Officer on a construction site and I wanted to know more about how different people behaved.

What is your favourite way to relax from studying ? I’m a Barcelona FC and a Liverpool fan so when I’m relaxing, especially on weekends, I like watching soccer. I also likes travelling and seeing new places. Where are you working and what are you studying now? I am working as a Safety Health and Environmental Officer at Onel Electrical Engineers Ltd in Harare, Zimbabwe.

Our project of bringing top quality education and training to anyone, anywhere, at any time, is not limited to workplace and professional skills. We believe that every individual on the planet should have access to the information necessary to save it. We have always been committed to promoting accurate and up-to-date information on the challenges facing our global family of learners, from coronavirus to climate change. As the situation evolves, we will continue to produce vital courses outlining how individuals and companies can affect changes that can reduce emissions and protect the planet. Central to our mission is our alignment with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, the UN’s “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all people and the world by 2030”. The idea of sustainability is woven into the fabric of what we do. Alison is a remote company, which means that our team is not centralised in a single building but rather is based in a variety of locations around the world. This allows us to reduce our carbon footprint by slashing office energy usage and also elimates the fuel consumption of commuting. As a digital only enterprise, we also operate with zero paper waste. At the heart of our project is our belief in the endless potential for good that comes from leveraging technology for online learning. Through our online platform, and more recently through the Alison App, we allow millions of Learners around the world to gain a quality education without any of the environmental costs that are inherent in bricks and mortar schooling. Our model means no paper waste, no schoolbus fumes, no lights left on in the school overnight. Our Learners are taking part not just in an educational revolution, but an environmental one. To mark the 2021 United Nations’ Climate Change Conference, we reached out to our employees around the world and asked them what action they took to play their part in the fight against climate change. We were inundated with tips and advice and from their suggestions we’ve put together ten recommendations for leading a more sustainable life. 1. Energy Instead of using traditional oil or gas sources to generate power, consider alternative energy options such as solar panelling. 2. Garden By germinating and growing fruit tree seedlings, you can distribute them to friends in order to increase the number of trees to absorb carbon. When working in your garden, be conscious of planting more water-wise plants and plants that help to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air. You can also recycle much of your kitchen waste for compost, which both benefits the garden and saves you money on fertiliser. 3. Food shopping When shopping, select fruit and vegetables which are not wrapped in plastic and which are locally grown when possible. Use canvas, rather than plastic, bags and if you do happen to get plastic bags, make sure to reuse them as much as possible. Avoid buying single use plastics and buy food that comes in glass, cardboard or tin as much as possible. 4. Diet Follow a vegan diet for 5 days a week and a vegetarian one for the other 2, as these diets have far lower carbon footprints than meat-heavy diets. You should also try and eat food that’s in season. 5. Toiletries Buy toiletries from whole sale or refill shops where you can buy them by the litre and bring your own reusable containers. Many sustainable, water-saving and environmentally friendly personal care products are now very easy to source, such as bamboo toothbrushes, organic loofahs, reusable make-up remover pads, shampoo bars and bamboo cotton buds. 6. Transport Limit your fuel emissions by walking and cycling as much as possible and using public transport when you can. 7. Water Conservation Catch cold water from the shower in a bucket to use in the toilet and garden or to wash floors, rather than let it go down the drain. 8. Education Learn about the science behind climate change in order to be better informed about how you can implement the most effective changes in your own daily routines. 9. Paper Waste Reduction Use recycled toilet paper and, instead of using kitchen role/paper towel, use reusable cloths. Invest in a reusable coffee cup and straw to reduce cardboard waste. 10. Clothes Shopping Shop from charity shops as much as possible and don’t buy new clothes or shoes until the old ones are worn out. Limit your new clothing purchases to local and ethically sourced materials, and learn to repair clothes that can be fixed.","length":4669,"tokens":924,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Alison: Playing Our Part in Combating Climate Change","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-playing-our-part-in-combating-climate-change","essay_date":"Nov 5, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"At Alison, we believe that our commitment to fighting climate change goes hand-in-hand with our devotion to empowerment through education.

How we heat our homes, get from A to B and feed our families all has an impact on the climate and the health of the natural world. But we don’t just have responsibilities as private citizens. The contribution of the world of industry, commerce, retail and services to climate change far outweighs that of private citizens in their homes. This means that we all have duties as employees to do what we can to limit the damage done by our places of work. To mark the Climate Change Conference, we’ve selected 5 courses that can teach you invaluable ways to reduce the carbon footprint of your workplace. Environmental Education: Climate Change – The Science Essential to making progress in the fight against climate change is improving people’s understanding of the pressing nature of what’s going on. The news cycle is full of examples of the increasingly frightening realities of climate change but not everyone reads the news or can connect the dots. This course gives a level-headed and insightful explanation of the science that everyone should know. Before trying to implement positive changes in your workplace, you should organise an office information day to make sure that everyone is on the same page. Sustainability and Climate Change Sustainability is a principle that needs to be applied to all workplace decisions. From what stockists you order supplies from to how you coordinate transport for business trips, you can always make a better and more environmentally sustainable choice. The green option is no longer the expensive option as the green market is rapidly expanding and driving down the price of the “eco option” across a variety of areas, from printer cartridges to canteen supplies. Many unsustainable choices continue to be made in the workplace simply because they are the way things have always been. Employers will listen if you arrive with a greener alternative that can be readily implemented to improve an existing situation. The Role of Accountants in Climate Change Implementing wholesale changes to reduce the carbon footprint of your workplace isn’t something that happens overnight nor is it something that you can do lightly. In order to be sustainable for both the planet and the company, the existing financial situation of the company will have to be assessed, as well the affect that greener policies will have. Many initiatives such as introducing solar power or cycle to work schemes come with tax breaks. Accountants need to be aware of all these potential financial incentives to make sure that the company isn’t missing out on any benefits of going green. Productivity and Waste Management – Lean and Environmental Perspectives The best way to manage waste is to prevent it. Waste management starts not with disposal, but with choosing raw materials and items that come with the least amount of packaging and collateral waste. This means that waste management needs to be considered at all points of the supply chain and at all levels of the business. This course looks at a variety of ways in which workplace waste can be managed, with an emphasis on the environment. Solar Energy – Solar Technology and Its Use Worldwide Every workplace, regardless of industry, needs to reassess its energy usage.

How we heat our homes, get from A to B and feed our families all has an impact on the climate and the health of the natural world. But we don’t just have responsibilities as private citizens. The contribution of the world of industry, commerce, retail and services to climate change far outweighs that of private citizens in their homes. This means that we all have duties as employees to do what we can to limit the damage done by our places of work. To mark the Climate Change Conference, we’ve selected 5 courses that can teach you invaluable ways to reduce the carbon footprint of your workplace.

This course gives a level-headed and insightful explanation of the science that everyone should know. Before trying to implement positive changes in your workplace, you should organise an office information day to make sure that everyone is on the same page. Sustainability and Climate Change Sustainability is a principle that needs to be applied to all workplace decisions. From what stockists you order supplies from to how you coordinate transport for business trips, you can always make a better and more environmentally sustainable choice. The green option is no longer the expensive option as the green market is rapidly expanding and driving down the price of the “eco option” across a variety of areas, from printer cartridges to canteen supplies. Many unsustainable choices continue to be made in the workplace simply because they are the way things have always been.","content_length":1029,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"5 Ways to Make Your Workplace Greener","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/5-ways-to-make-your-workplace-greener","essay_date":"Nov 3, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Employers will listen if you arrive with a greener alternative that can be readily implemented to improve an existing situation. The Role of Accountants in Climate Change Implementing wholesale changes to reduce the carbon footprint of your workplace isn’t something that happens overnight nor is it something that you can do lightly. In order to be sustainable for both the planet and the company, the existing financial situation of the company will have to be assessed, as well the affect that greener policies will have. Many initiatives such as introducing solar power or cycle to work schemes come with tax breaks. Accountants need to be aware of all these potential financial incentives to make sure that the company isn’t missing out on any benefits of going green.

This month, steps are being taken at the highest level to combat climate change and preserve our planet’s natural resources. However it’s down to all of us as individuals to do our fair share and put pressure on decision makers to act quickly and responsibly. The first step, before action, is education. At Alison, we are dedicated to empowering people through learning and not just in terms of career development. We believe that by informing our learners about the realities of climate change, we can empower them to play their part in protecting our planet. Here are five vital courses for informing yourself about the hurdles facing our world and how we can contribute to overcoming them. 1. Know The Science In these strange times of fake news and “alternative facts”, climate change has become a mire of conflicting narratives, many of them false. With so much at stake, it’s crucial that you ground yourself in the scientific realities of the effect humanity is having on the planet. 2. Floods Western Europe was devastated by flooding this year, with a shocking loss of life in some of the world’s most developed economies. It goes to show that climate change does not discriminate in who it affects. This course will bring you up to speed in how we can best manage our water ways to avoid similar devastation in the future. 3. Waste Waste reduction is essential in combatting the threats to the planet. The unnecessary use of energy is a drain on the earth’s natural resources and a company’s financial resources. Better resource management can be easily managed by putting an Environmental Management System in place that aligns with ISO standards. 4. Fuels One of the shining hopes for the future is the success we’re seeing in alternative energy sources. From wind to solar, biofuel to geothermal, humanity has gone back to the drawing board and come up with a variety of green alternatives to fossil fuels. However, from China to Australia, developed nations are continuing to grow their fossil fuel industries, showing that it’s still vital to spread awareness of fossil fuel replacements in order to reduce demand for these damaging fuels. 5. Environmental Management Whether it’s your garden, the fields behind your house or your office green space, there is no patch of earth too small to make a difference. This course will teach you everything you need to know to improve the environmental conditions of the spaces nearest to you and closest to your heart.

She has worked in classrooms around the world and taught students from various backgrounds and a diverse range of countries, from Japan to Ukraine to Brazil. Justine is passionate about spreading knowledge of the English language and spoke to the Alison Blog about her teaching inspiration, the day to day business of being a teacher, and why becoming an ESL teacher is such a rewarding career choice. Hi Justine, did you always want to teach English as a second language? If so, what attracted you to the job? This is an interesting question because the answer is both “yes” and “no”. When I was in high school, I wanted to be an English teacher. English was my favorite subject and I have always enjoyed the process of learning different languages, so being an English as a second language (ESL) teacher sounded like the perfect job. Then I started university and did some practice teaching and decided it wasn’t for me. I was 17 at the time and didn’t have the right temperament to be a teacher. From that moment, I decided to change my major at university and focus on other career options for a while. What has been your path to your current job? As you might guess, it has been a non-traditional path. Before I became an ESL teacher, I had many different jobs but none of them felt like a career. I worked in fashion, retail, customer service, home improvement, and finance, to name just a few. After many years of working in a lot of different fields, I wanted to change careers and decided to pursue my dream of becoming a teacher again. I started by doing some volunteer teaching work in my community while I completed a teaching certification online. After getting my certificate, I got my first job as an ESL teacher in Japan. That was almost five years ago. Since then, I have traveled and taught all over the world while developing my skills as a teacher. Through my work in the classroom, I have discovered that I am most passionate about materials development and so took on freelance work to get experience in that area. What has been the most important skill you’ve had to develop teaching English as a second language? Patience. This is, without a doubt, the single most important skill I’ve developed as an ESL teacher. There are many courses and books and videos that can prepare you to become an ESL teacher and they teach you a lot of necessary skills, like how to make a lesson plan, how to teach grammar, how to create classroom activities, and so on. But there is no class that can prepare you for a student that is having a bad day and starts crying during a lesson or a student that struggles with comprehension. Patience is a skill learned on the job. What does a typical day look like for an English language teacher? Generally speaking, a typical day for an English teacher starts pretty early. Teachers working at public and private schools usually start classes between 8 and 9 in the morning. Language academies may start a bit later in the morning, but the classes there often go on late into the evening. Classes often range from 35 minutes to several hours. Depending on the length of the class, a teacher may only have one or two classes per day or up to seven. Teachers usually have a lunch break in the middle of the day and a short break period between each class. During break periods or after school teachers need to prepare for upcoming lessons. What skill do you have to use the most in a typical day? As a teacher, you use the four major language related skills (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) everyday. Besides these obvious skills, teachers rely heavily on their soft skills, especially time management and creative thinking. Time management is a critical skill for teachers because you have a limited amount of time to cover all the material in a given day and the challenge is how to present, produce, and practice while managing students, questions, and challenges. This is also where creative thinking is used – what if the game or activity isn’t going as planned? Teachers need to be able to adjust their lessons immediately to cater to the needs of each class. Why would you encourage our Learners to choose your profession? Teaching overall is a very rewarding profession, but I think being an English teacher is doubly so because of the impact you can have on people’s lives. There are over 1.5 billion people learning English and each person has their own reason. As an ESL teacher, you can help people accomplish their personal English goals. If you could recommend our Learners to upskill in one area in order to become a successful English language teacher, what would it be? English! There are many skills required to be a successful English teacher, but the most important one is having a good command of the English language. It’s not enough to just speak English well, you also need to understand the various components of the language and how they work together. For another skill besides English, I would recommend public speaking. As a teacher, you are constantly presenting and talking to groups of people and public speaking skills, such as organizing material and watching for feedback, are useful in the classroom. What’s the best part about your career? The best part about being an ESL teacher is meeting people from all over the world. As a teacher, I have met countless people and learned about their histories, cultures, and lives. It is a very humbling and eye-opening experience that reminds you how big the world really is.

After getting my certificate, I got my first job as an ESL teacher in Japan. That was almost five years ago. Since then, I have traveled and taught all over the world while developing my skills as a teacher. Through my work in the classroom, I have discovered that I am most passionate about materials development and so took on freelance work to get experience in that area. What has been the most important skill you’ve had to develop teaching English as a second language? Patience. This is, without a doubt, the single most important skill I’ve developed as an ESL teacher. There are many courses and books and videos that can prepare you to become an ESL teacher and they teach you a lot of necessary skills, like how to make a lesson plan, how to teach grammar, how to create classroom activities, and so on.","content_length":929,"content_tokens":190,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"A Day in the Life of an English as a Second Language Teacher: Justine Dalke","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-english-as-a-second-language-teacher-justine-dalke","essay_date":"Oct 25, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"But there is no class that can prepare you for a student that is having a bad day and starts crying during a lesson or a student that struggles with comprehension. Patience is a skill learned on the job. What does a typical day look like for an English language teacher? Generally speaking, a typical day for an English teacher starts pretty early. Teachers working at public and private schools usually start classes between 8 and 9 in the morning. Language academies may start a bit later in the morning, but the classes there often go on late into the evening. Classes often range from 35 minutes to several hours. Depending on the length of the class, a teacher may only have one or two classes per day or up to seven. Teachers usually have a lunch break in the middle of the day and a short break period between each class. During break periods or after school teachers need to prepare for upcoming lessons.","content_length":912,"content_tokens":180,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"A Day in the Life of an English as a Second Language Teacher: Justine Dalke","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-english-as-a-second-language-teacher-justine-dalke","essay_date":"Oct 25, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"What skill do you have to use the most in a typical day? As a teacher, you use the four major language related skills (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) everyday. Besides these obvious skills, teachers rely heavily on their soft skills, especially time management and creative thinking. Time management is a critical skill for teachers because you have a limited amount of time to cover all the material in a given day and the challenge is how to present, produce, and practice while managing students, questions, and challenges. This is also where creative thinking is used – what if the game or activity isn’t going as planned? Teachers need to be able to adjust their lessons immediately to cater to the needs of each class. Why would you encourage our Learners to choose your profession? Teaching overall is a very rewarding profession, but I think being an English teacher is doubly so because of the impact you can have on people’s lives.","content_length":953,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"A Day in the Life of an English as a Second Language Teacher: Justine Dalke","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-english-as-a-second-language-teacher-justine-dalke","essay_date":"Oct 25, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"There are over 1.5 billion people learning English and each person has their own reason. As an ESL teacher, you can help people accomplish their personal English goals. If you could recommend our Learners to upskill in one area in order to become a successful English language teacher, what would it be? English! There are many skills required to be a successful English teacher, but the most important one is having a good command of the English language. It’s not enough to just speak English well, you also need to understand the various components of the language and how they work together. For another skill besides English, I would recommend public speaking. As a teacher, you are constantly presenting and talking to groups of people and public speaking skills, such as organizing material and watching for feedback, are useful in the classroom. What’s the best part about your career? The best part about being an ESL teacher is meeting people from all over the world. As a teacher, I have met countless people and learned about their histories, cultures, and lives. It is a very humbling and eye-opening experience that reminds you how big the world really is.

He has been playing since he was 8 years old and has won a host of prizes both individually and with bands at All-Ireland Fleadhs over the years. Born into a musical family in Ireland’s musical heartlands, Conor also has a passion for passing on the tradition and teaches concertina with Music Generation, an organisation committed to providing accessible music education to children around the country. Conor directed his passions for both music and teaching into the Concertina Courses which he has produced for Alison. Hi Conor, tell us a bit about yourself! My name is Conor O’Loughlin. I’m 23 and I’m from a small village in County Clare called Corofin. There’s a lot of music around the area. Corofin is steeped in traditional music going back generations and the next small village is Kilfenora, which is famous for the Kilfenora Céilí Band. When I was 6, I started learning the tin whistle first and then began playing the concertina when I was 8. I’ve been playing it ever since. How did you get into Irish traditional music? There’s a lot music in my family. My mother plays the button accordion and my two brothers play the flute and banjo. My cousins play as well and probably my first experience of hearing the concertina was from my cousin. I just loved the sound of it and was naturally drawn to it. As kids we were given the option of choosing what instrument we wanted to pick and so I picked the concertina. I studied with Noel Hill for about a year and a half and then I went to Tim Collins, a Limerick concertina player based in Clare. I started entering Fleadhs, both solo and with different bands and groups, and did very well up through the age groups. How did your relationship with music change as you got older? After my Leaving Cert, I wanted to continue with music so I studied traditional music in the University of LImerick. There were auditions because it’s a performance-based course and so you had to have music going into it. You play everyday and you have a tutor for your first instrument. Obviously my first instrument was the concertina but there were lots of other with various first instruments. They have state of the art facilities in UL, with a specific building for music called the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance. The course I was doing was called Irish Music and Dance, so we focused on those subjects but the topics we studied branched out to things like jazz theory, the background behind music, and how it’s linked to education and therapy. Performance-wise it was strictly Irish music, but music-wise generally, it was quite broad. Tell us about your experience teaching with Music Generation. Music Generation was set up by U2 and it’s an organisation that believes that every child, no matter what the circumstances, should have the opportunity to experience and learn music. It started in Dublin and it has now spread country-wide. Nearly every county has a Music Generation programme. I’ve been teaching with them for a year now. This year, we got funding for a concertina orchestra – 44 children between the ages of 10 and 18, all playing concertinas. They had to audition for it and there was music written specifically for them. We recorded a concert in Glór Theatre in Ennis in April and that premiered online earlier this month. Can you give us a bit of background on the concertina in Ireland? The concertina is a German instrument and the story goes that it was brought over to Ireland by cargo ships coming over from Germany and got dropped off in Shannon some time in the nineteenth century. County Clare has always been renowned for concertina players, and music generally. There had been great players down the years like Elizabeth Crotty and Chris Droney, who only died last year. The father figure with regards to our generation of concertina players is Noel Hill. He really re-energised and reinvented the playing of concertina music. Since him, then there’s been a flurry of great concertina players. When I was competing in Fleadhs, there was nearly 40 competing in the Clare Fleadh alone and the standard was out of this world. What is it that you love about the concertina? There’s so much you can do on the concertina. With say the flute, for example, you can only play the melody or the harmony. Whereas with the concertina you can add chording. A chord is when you play two or more notes at the same time and by doing that you can actually accompany yourself using chords. I talk about that in the course. The concertina isn’t an easy instrument to learn but it’s very satisfying when you get to the point of being able to play a tune and add chords to it. What is it about Irish music that makes it so appealing? It’s such a big community and yet so small – every body knows each other and it’s very close-knit. At traditional festivals, no matter where you go in the country, you’re going to know somebody. You also have a great opportunity to go travelling. When I was studying in Limerick, I was in a band and we travelled the States and Europe. We were in the States twice, travelling and playing festivals and organised gigs. And then when covid started, we were actually in Austria. We just got back before things went into lockdown! Why would you recommend learning Irish music to people? Irish music is extremely social and you get to meet so many people. Traditional music is also based around improvisation. When I go and play a session, I may have a completely different version of a tune from the person next to me, so we improvise and work around each other. So you form friendships very easily through music. It’s a hobby after all so, at a session, you’ve a similar interest to the person sitting beside you playing.

Dermot started playing the bodhrán aged 6 and has 25 years experience of the instrument. A professional musician for the last ten years, he is a member of the Limerick band Hermitage Green, as part of which he has toured the world and achieved two top 5 albums. Dermot is the force behind Alison’s Bodhrán Courses, released this month as part of our Traditional Irish Music hub. He spoke to the Alison Blog about his love for the instrument, his professional experience and why the bodhrán is the perfect instrument through which to learn about traditional Irish music. So Dermot, how did you get into Irish music? I started playing because I’m from a musical family. My dad is a great set-dancer and I have two older sisters that played traditional music – the flute and fiddle. I was the young sibling that used to tag along and the bodhrán was an easy instrument to give to the youngest to tip away with lightly in the corner. Then when I was around 6 at a Fleadh (traditional Irish music competition) in Listowel, I remember seeing a bodhrán player called Neil Lyons playing in the Listowel Arms and just being glued to the hypnotic rhythm of the instrument. It was quite tribal and I just remember feeling, “Oh, I want to do this. This is class.” That was transformative for me. Then when I was twelve years of age I fell deeply in love with a band called Flook, and also Michael McGoldrick, and I just wanted to learn and play as much bodhrán as I could. I taught myself by playing along with all my favourite trad albums and it went from there. Did you play throughout your school days? When I was in secondary school I started competing in the Fleadhs in solo competitions in both the bodhrán and the drums. Throughout my time in school I was also playing drums in the Inis Óg Céilí Band and we’d compete in the Fleadhs too. Céilí band music is very important in County Clare. Traditional music is essentially dance music. It’s meant to accompany dancing, which is why it’s so lively and full of craic and rhythm. While at school, I won 7 All-Irelands across bodhrán, drums and céilí bands. Also, when I was 16, I did a couple of tours with the Irish Harp Orchestra, across Germany and Cyprus. That was an unusual one because I got to play some of the finest concert halls I’ve still ever played in my life, like the Munich Philharmonic and the Cologne Philharmonic. How did you end up becoming a professional musician? So I didn’t study music in college, I studied real estate. But when I was 19 I got selected by Dónal Lunny to be in a band called Ciorras, which was formed as part of an series for TG4. It was about picking eight young people with different personalities and putting them together to form a band. It was anchored around the construction of a new percussion instrument and that was called the greadán, which was essentially a drumkit of bodhráns. After filming we toured a good bit with Ciorras, and I was playing both the bodhrán and the greadán. I was playing with other bands as well at the time and then Hermitage Green came along when I was 21. They were still playing covers in bars and then once I joined we started doing more original stuff and stopped doing cover gigs. We started doing ticketed gigs and it’s all progressed very naturally. We’ve signed to Sony music, sold out shows around the world and also had two top 5 selling albums. Tell us a bit about the history of the bodhrán. The bodhrán has evolved hugely over the last sixty years. Originally it was largely seen as a ceremonial instrument that was only taken out once a year on Saint Stephen’s Day when it was beaten by the neighbours when they called around to the house. It was really in the fifties, when Seán Ó Riada brought it in to a concert hall setting, that it was formally introduced into the traditional idiom. Over time it continued to develop. Hand techniques changed, tonal work started to emerge and then the stick was added for playing. What is it that you love about the bodhrán? And why would you encourage others to learn it? The bodhrán is an unbelievably diverse instrument and it’s a great instrument for people to learn if they’re interested in traditional music. You can get good quite quickly if you have good rhythm and timing, so it’s quite accessible. Also there aren’t a lot of limitations to it across genres. With the bodhrán, I play traditional music but fifty percent of the music I play is non-traditional. You can rock up with the bodhrán to anything, it’s limitless. In my course, I teach traditional music but I also teach that you can apply the beats that I have taught you across so many different genres of music. The way the instrument will evolve in the future is by players listening to other styles of percussion and hopping in with that. It’s an all-round instrument and a great gateway for people getting into traditional music. Why would you recommend learning Irish music to people? Learning traditional music and opening yourself up to the traditional music community, you’ll be surprised at the abundance and the welcome across the world that you’ll be tapping into. It’s such a wide-spanning community. When I travel, I meet people who play traditional music all over the world. Someone at the start may be completely unaware of the support networks that are out there for traditional music, online also. Traditional music is a great gift. It’s also naturally and distinctively Irish. If you’re looking to be connected to the flow of what it means to be Irish, then you should choose traditional music.

With the bodhrán, I play traditional music but fifty percent of the music I play is non-traditional. You can rock up with the bodhrán to anything, it’s limitless. In my course, I teach traditional music but I also teach that you can apply the beats that I have taught you across so many different genres of music.","content_length":796,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Dermot Sheedy: “In my course, I teach that you can apply the beats that I’ve taught you across so many different genres of music.”","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/dermot-sheedy-in-my-course-i-teach-that-you-can-apply-the-beats-that-ive-taught-you-across-so-many-different-genres-of-music","essay_date":"Oct 25, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"The way the instrument will evolve in the future is by players listening to other styles of percussion and hopping in with that. It’s an all-round instrument and a great gateway for people getting into traditional music. Why would you recommend learning Irish music to people? Learning traditional music and opening yourself up to the traditional music community, you’ll be surprised at the abundance and the welcome across the world that you’ll be tapping into. It’s such a wide-spanning community. When I travel, I meet people who play traditional music all over the world. Someone at the start may be completely unaware of the support networks that are out there for traditional music, online also. Traditional music is a great gift. It’s also naturally and distinctively Irish. If you’re looking to be connected to the flow of what it means to be Irish, then you should choose traditional music. Start your journey into Ireland’s musical heritage by checking out Alison’s Bodhrán courses now!

He is passionate about improving the lives of others and combines his PhD in Clinical Psychology with the latest holistic and wellbeing therapies to provide the very best care for individuals seeking to improve their mental health. Besides practicing as a mental health professional, Chris also loves to share advice about helpful mental health practices that can improve your wellbeing. Workplace anxiety can be a real roadblock to career success and affects many employees at different points in their working life. The Alison Blog has teamed with Chris so he can share his four top tips for tacking workplace anxiety and help you reach your full potential at work. Work takes up such a large proportion of our lives that when an aspect of it becomes less than desirable, it can have a huge impact. If your job is anxiety-inducing for you, it can have a knock-on effect into other areas of your life. The workplace should be an environment where everyone can feel comfortable and able to thrive, and it’s only through addressing mental health that this can be achieved. Whether you’re a business owner looking to create a more positive workplace culture for your staff or you’re an employee struggling with anxiety yourself, here are some tips for tackling workplace anxiety. 1. Talk it out Talking is important, and it has more of an effect than you might realise when you’re dealing with anxiety. Being able to talk about what is worrying you can alleviate some of the burden, but it also enables you to let your manager know what’s going on so they can support you. When you work closely with other people, it can help to have their understanding so that when you’re having a difficult time, they know why and how best to help you. When we keep things bottled up, they can become overwhelming. In talking to someone about your fears, you may be able to see your situation from a different perspective, or they may have solutions for you that you hadn’t considered. 2. Request time off Work makes up a big chunk of our lives, so if it’s causing you anxiety, you should take some time off to recuperate. Investing energy into your recovery and your mental health isn’t just beneficial for you, it also makes you a better employee – you can’t pour from an empty cup, and your employer will realize this. Discussing anxiety with your manager is tough, but it can be even harder to request time off. However, most employers understand that your health is a priority, so they’re likely to be more accepting of the situation that you may think. It’s also important to realize that you’re protected from a legal standpoint when it comes to seeking treatment for health conditions, which can provide peace of mind that your job is protected if you need time off. There’s plenty of research to support the fact that giving yourself plenty of regular breaks and a chance to decompress from work is essential for your mental health, but this is even more important if you have anxiety which can be exhausting, both physically and mentally. 3. Keep moving Sitting down for long periods impacts our mood in a negative way, which can worsen our anxiety at work. So, get moving and give yourself a change of scenery throughout the day which can help lift your mood. Wherever you work, taking the time every day to use your lunch break to get outside and go for a walk will give you the opportunity to move your body, breathe in some fresh air, and refresh for the rest of the day. This tip is worth remembering for those situations where you’re in the middle of an anxiety attack too – remove yourself from the environment where you’re struggling and take 10 minutes to calm down elsewhere. 4. Reframe your mindset Noticing your thoughts and worries is one of the techniques taught as part of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). With CBT, you confront your emotions and reframe them in a more positive light, to break the negative thought cycle. CBT techniques are something that can take time to develop, but when you’ve mastered them, they can be extremely useful in situations or places that cause you anxiety, such as work. Through this method, you’ll identify the problems or issues that cause you difficulty and become aware of the thought patterns you have and how they impact you. In doing this, you can learn to reshape the way you see these problems and learn new behaviors to cope with them. Final thoughts Anxiety is challenging to cope with regardless of the environment, but particularly if the cause is something that you spend so much of your time doing. Being mindful of your triggers, asking for support when you need it most, and taking the time to truly rest and recover will all help to reduce your anxiety in the workplace. But it’s also worth noting what about your workplace is affecting you – is it the people you’re working with, the tasks you’re being given, or something else? If there are elements of your job you can change, such as requesting different responsibilities or transferring to a different team, these may help to remove the triggers and resolve the issue by dealing with the root cause.","length":5187,"tokens":1066,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"4 Tips for Tackling Workplace Anxiety","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/4-tips-for-tackling-workplace-anxiety","essay_date":"Oct 22, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Chris Harley is a mental health professional based in San Francisco.

The project manager is the glue that holds a team together and needs to be in possession of a wide range of skills. They steer the ship in the right direction, motivate their team and help them achieve greater results. Project managers have to monitor progress, make sure deadlines are followed, and maintain constant communication with superiors, clients, and the team they’re managing. As such, strong leadership and communication skills are two vital attributes of a successful project manager. In total, there are 6 must-have qualities for all great project managers. Here are the 6 skills you need to develop to excel as a project manager. 1. Communication Regardless of what industry you’re in, communication is an essential skill. When it comes to project management, communication issues are among the most common problems. Missing information, poorly explained deadlines, a team member failing to understand the team strategy, any one of these can result in project failure. The most important content marketing pain points are about communication and being unique. When it comes to communicating effectively, it’s important to remember that too much information is always a bad thing. You need to be concise when expressing ideas while, at the same time, making sure your team has all the information they need. Structure is also crucial when it comes to communication. Make sure you give your team step-by-step instructions whenever you need to communicate something, rather than just giving them information in drib and drabs. 2. Process and Expectation Management A successful team is a team that knows what the expectations of their superiors are. They are aware of all the steps they need to follow and how to execute the tasks given to them. If you don’t explain the goal of the project and how to get there, then your team will not be able to deliver the desired results. The process that your team needs to follow should be streamlined and outlined to them clearly. This applies to deadlines as well. A good project manager sets very clear deadlines and makes sure everyone has the resources they need to meet them. 3. Learning Mindset In a highly competitive environment, everyone has to be continuously learning and upskilling. This is why you need to develop an intentional learning mindset. Adopting a learning mindset will not only help your team and your company to stay competitive, it will also make you a better leader. It’s not a surprise that the best leaders are constant learners. As a team manager, it’s your job to be aware of new trends and methods within your industry. A project manager that is not constantly improving in their role and growing their team is ultimately working against the growth of the company. 4. Teamwork A great project manager can utilize the strengths of each team member and achieve results by finding a harmony that allows everyone to be their best self. In order to find those strengths, you’ll need to listen. Listening is a very powerful tool for getting your team to achieve great results. There are many leaders out there who are focused on giving orders and telling people what to do but are not able to carefully listen to the team around them. By listening carefully, you will be able to give personalized instructions. As a result, the members of the team will respond better to your directions. Encouraging your team is very important. Don’t be the person who is only focused on bad results. Your team needs to know what works. Give them feedback and compliment their work. 5. Strong Leadership Managing a project can be demanding and stressful and there will be times when you will not have the answers. However, as the project manager you’re the one who needs to act. You need to stay composed and focused. If you are able to stay organized and calm during a storm, you will become a source of motivation for your team. People will be inspired by you and will try their best not to disappoint you. Strong leaders create strong teams. This podcast about leadership will give you insights from different professionals and help you to effectively lead your team. 6. Know the Tech A good project manager needs to follow trends in technology and know what are the best tools and apps available in their industry. Since the pandemic started, software outsourcing tools became a necessity for product managers, while tools like this website traffic checker can make your life easier by providing you with useful analytics. By following the latest developments in project management, you can learn how to implement new technologies which can improve the productivity of your team and create that competitive edge that all successful project managers want.

Eurika, from South Africa, has inspired countless individuals (including many Alison Learners) with her incredible story of empowerment and success. Through hard work and commitment, Eurika leveraged various educational opportunities to gain a series of impressive qualifications, including a doctorate. Her journey has been recognised by a variety of national organisations and Eurika is always keen to encourage others to seize the opportunities that education affords. Eurika spoke to the Alison Blog about her career as a medical professional, outlining the challenges and highlighting the best parts. Hi Eurika! Did you always want to be a medical professional? If so, what attracted you to the job? When I was in primary school I actually wanted to be a fashion designer. I still enjoy sketching. I got into the medical industry because I wanted to work in a lab. I wanted to know how viruses and diseases adapt and affect people and that’s when I got into Medical Sciences. What has been your path to your current job? My path to my current job was not an easy one at all. I hold qualifications in business management, journalism and entrepreneurship and have spent some time in those industries while studying part time for my medical certifications. Many of the people I worked with were confused and couldn’t understand how I was juggling both the corporate world and my passion for the medical industry. The truth is that those disciplines allowed me to save up and pay for my medical studies. What has been the most important skill you’ve had to develop as a medical professional? Patience! I have seen that in any industry patience is key. In my line of work right now as a Health and Wellness Practitioner, it’s very important that I am patient with myself, my patients, their conditions and the solutions we are bringing to bear. What does a typical day look like for you? As a Health and Wellness Practitioner, my usual day is as follows: I wake up in the morning and pray and read my devotionals. I have a look at my schedule for the day and go through the list of patients I need to see. Once at work, I ensure that my therapy rooms are set up and ready to offer support. With new patients, I go through their intake forms with them, check their medical history and discuss their current condition. Then I proceed with various therapy treatments to help them. For return patients, I follow up on their current state of health and offer counselling, support and various therapy treatments. I then ensure that the practice’s social media is up to date with our current offers and available supports. I also meet with the chief medical professional to discuss cases and how to proceed with them. Done for the day, I then head home to spend time with my husband. What skill do you have to use the most in a typical day? Counseling and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Why would you encourage our Learners to choose your profession? As a Health and Wellness Practitioner, I offer holistic support to my patients. Along with physical health care treatments, I offer timely mental health care that gives the patient an understanding of what they are going through. This profession allows me to be my own boss as I am able to manage my time and my work. The flexibility allows me to also ensure that I can continue up-skilling daily. I have certified as a Colon Hydrotherapy Practitioner and as a Trauma Counselor as well. I have also added Medical Nutritional Therapy to the support offerings for my patients. If you could recommend our Learners to upskill in one area in order to become a successful medical professional, what would it be? Being a successful medical professional requires you to know how to manage your own mental health! Be sure to take time off, be sure to debrief when supporting traumatic cases and be patient with yourself. What’s the best part about your career? The one-on-one, personalized interactions with patients. There can be no one size fits all approach in medicine. Every person who comes in is treated according to their unique needs.

Working with a variety of different e-learning platforms, SkildLabs takes clients from brainstorming, storyboarding, script writing, to filming, video-editing, effects and platform configuration. Lachezar spoke to the Alison Blog about his experience of running SkildLabs as CEO. From the vital skills required to manage a company, to how he spends his day, Lachezar offers professional advise and tips on how to be a successful CEO in the modern workplace. Hi Lachezar, tell us a bit about yourself! I started my career in digital marketing for tech companies. I worked for a start-up and then I worked for Microsoft in core marketing for products like Visual Studio, Microsoft Azure and Hololens. I got to see the operational structure of a very large company and it was very digital savvy in terms of learning. I was responsible for the marketing around channels like Microsoft virtual academy and channel 9. And so though it was marketing for developers and IT professionals and it was very technical, I did also get to see the learning side of it. That got me into the whole e-learning industry and edtech. However I didn’t really pursue it and, after that, I worked in the advertising world. I shifted gears into analytics and that really complimented the core marketing I had learned. In my last advertising agency role, I got to work with a lot of different businesses across all types of verticals and I learned a lot about client relationships. I created a training programme for one of the agencies and I feel like, throughout my career, I was always going back to learning. Did you always want to be a CEO? If so, what attracted you to the job? I’ve always had the urge to execute my own vision. I’ve always had a vision of how things should be done and of course mistakes will be made along the way but I was willing to take the risks to make the mistakes so that so I could learn more. You don’t get to have that when you work for somebody else. It wasn’t about being a “CEO”, I’ve never been a fan of titles. But I’ve always had my own ideas and it was really about the freedom and the fact that now I can execute my own ideas. The other great thing is that I can take projects that I want to work on and work with people that I like to work with. I feel like that’s when you get the best out of yourself and the people around you. That’s when you put yourself in an environment where you can be the most creative and that’s when ideas come up. That was really the enticing bit. What has been your path to your current job? Two years prior to creating the company, I started doing online courses. I had all this experience with doing courses and training programmes with the agencies, and then all of the work at Microsoft. So I started building these courses and I launched the first course in 2019 on Data Visualisation. I built a whole curriculum, shot all the videos, did a combination between talking head and screencast. Building a course is almost like creating a business because you start with nothing. Then I really started thinking more about the edtech industry and obviously during the pandemic there was an incredible boom of people wanting to take courses and change the way they learn. Education is being completely transformed at the moment. What has been the most important skill you’ve had to develop as a CEO? I think resourcefulness is a key skill when you’re running a company. You’re in control of what projects you take on but that’s a responsibility as well. You have to figure out how you are going to use the resources that are available to you. When it’s not a huge company you don’t have a lot so you have to be smart about the resources you use. That’s something I’ve exercised and practiced in the past but now it’s even more accentuated and that’s something that I like. I like combining things that don’t really go together. I think that’s why the courses I create are unique and really well received by people. I’ll combine, let’s say, analytics and creative design. I like to combine things that normally don’t seem to go together but when combined in the right way are really powerful. You can see that in the training and learning experiences that SkildLabs create. What does a typical day look like for you as a CEO? We’re still in the first six months of the company and I’m sure that every six months it’s going to be different. When you create your own company, work is more than 9 to 5. It lasts the whole day because a lot of different things are coming your way. Normally what I’ll try to do is to have a couple of priorities and top projects that I’m working on and, in the morning, I’ll check where those are headed and what has to be moved along. I split them between things I have to have an active part in and things where my role is more passive. With the active things that need my attention, I look after them first so they can keep moving. And then on certain days, I don’t arrange any meetings. This is really important and something I didn’t get in other jobs. In order for you to come up with a new idea or see something new you almost have to leave a day of just thinking. You can’t force creativity. This is how I’ll come up with the next idea for a learning experience or a collaboration we can do with a partner or client. I leave gaps so I have that opportunity to be creative. What skill do you have to use the most in a typical day? I try to make a distinction between analytical thinking and analytics. People think that analytics is all about numbers but analytical thinking is something that I try to practice and use as a skill. It’s really about applying data and quantitative information and using it to make decisions or come up with new ideas. There is so much data everywhere. Every company is producing data, every tool you open will have analytics, so using the vast amount of data that is out there to make decisions or spike your creativity, I think that’s really important. You shouldn’t be afraid of analytics as something that analysts and data scientists do. It’s pretty much what everybody should be doing now. You need to be data driven in your decision-making. If you could recommend our Learners to upskill in one area in order to become a successful CEO, what would it be? I never viewed myself as a salesman or thought that I would ever use that as a core skill but actually it’s very important. I think everyone should be good at sales to some extent. Because even if you’re applying for a job, you’re selling the skills that you have and you’re explaining why you should be part of the company. You’re technically engaging in a sort of sales meeting. That’s one thing I felt I had to improve because, when you talk to clients, you have to make sure that you create a succinct pitch or offering. What’s the best part about your career? The flexibility and the freedom of choice. The fact that I can pick the projects and develop areas that before I would have had to wait for approval for a long time for, or that might have been considered risky. Whereas now I can just pursue a project or client and, though it might fail, at least I can learn from that. I feel that sometimes with companies they don’t always allow you to fail that fast and figure out if this specific project or prospect is for you. That flexibility and freedom to pick your own projects and work with clients that you want to work with, I think that brings out the best in you.

After the pandemic and the struggles that have come with it, it’s perhaps a more important day than in years past. To mark World Mental Health Day, we’ve compiled a list of five courses that will help shine a light on mental wellbeing by raising awareness and spreading education on the subject. These courses range from providing the facts that could lead to preventive strategies, to courses that offer mechanisms for dealing with pre-existing conditions. ff Diploma in Mental Health Mental health is a broad definition that covers emotional, psychological and social well-being, as well as how we think, feel and behave. Understanding our own mental health and that of those around us greatly improves how we negotiate stress, interact with others and make important choices. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted critical mental health services in many countries worldwide, while the demand for mental health is increasing. This diploma course will provide important knowledge for your own wellbeing and those of others around you. Mental Health Studies – Suicide, Violent Behavior and Substance Abuse The pandemic and the resulting economic crisis have negatively affected many people’s mental health. New barriers and challenges for people already suffering from mental illness and substance abuse have been created. Educating ourselves about mental health issues and the many subsequent challenges that arise from them, means we are better equipped to assist our friends, colleagues and families who are struggling. Even a short course like this can result in the knowledge that can prevent a tragedy. Diploma in Psychology Psychology is the study of the mind and human behaviour. It’s a field of study that looks at how biological influences, social pressures, and environmental factors all interact and affect how people think, behave, and feel. With this course, you will gain a richer and deeper understanding of the science of psychology by studying core principles, field research, and clinical findings. By upskilling in this fascinating and evolving science, you’ll gain insights that can help you to help manage and overcome mental distress, as well as being able to help others. Mental Health Studies – Understanding Behaviour, Burnout and Depression A stressful lifestyle can put people under extreme pressure, to the point that they feel exhausted, empty, burned out, and unable to cope. People often use the terms burnout and depression interchangeably, whereas they have very different causes and treatments. Where depression falls under mental health, burnout is usually related to external factors like work or lifestyle. This course explains the main symptoms of burnout and depression and clarifies what treatment and support is required. Supporting Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities and Mental Illness Intellectual disabilities can make communication extremely difficult. Around 1 in 5 people with an intellectual disability also have a mental health disorder, which can often go undiagnosed, untreated or just neglected. Learning how to support individuals with intellectual disabilities with mental illnesses is crucial in making sure that vulnerable people have access to the same care and compassion as everyone else. This course will provide an overview on the appropriate terminology to use and how to support and care for people living with intellectual disabilities.","length":3529,"tokens":640,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"5 Courses to mark World Mental Health Day","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/5-courses-to-mark-world-mental-health-day","essay_date":"Oct 13, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"This week includes World Mental Health Day, a day on which attention is drawn to our mental wellbeing and that of others.

You have to manage multiple clients, stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends, and track the results of your work. This can get overwhelming but, if you have the right tools and resources, you can save yourself time, stay on top of things, and get better results. To help you successfully manage your workload and thrive under pressure , Alex Ratynski, founder of online marketing consultancy Ratynski Digital has shared his list of six powerful tools and resources that will make your life as a marketing freelancer much easier. fff 1. Eliminate the guesswork with time tracking software As a freelancer, it can sometimes be difficult to make sure you get paid what you are owed. One of the best ways to ensure you do is with time-tracking software that calculates how much time you’ve spent on a particular project. There are lots of benefits to using a tool like this. Firstly, it will make it much easier for you to show clients how much work you’ve put into a particular job. And they won’t be able to doubt you, because there’ll be proof of every second! A time-tracking tool can also help you to be more productive by ensuring that you don’t work more than you need to. Spending more time than allotted on a task can leave you with less time to devote to other projects, and will drive your hourly rate down. 2. Use templates to create professional-looking invoices Freelance work tends to involve a lot of invoicing. One of the best ways to ensure you include all of the relevant information and present clients with polished and professional-looking invoices is to use a template created by experts. You’ll want to choose invoice templates that are affordable and easy to use. You won’t want to spend a lot of time navigating complicated features, and you also won’t want to spend too much money doing it — your goal is to make money, after all. FreshBooks is an accounting software provider that specializes in helping freelancers and small businesses to get the most out of their money. They’ve created a range of free invoice templates that will work for you, whatever you sell. And they can even be customized to reflect your branding, giving them a very professional finish. 3. Track your social media success with analytics tools In this increasingly online world, it can sometimes feel like you always need to be posting on every single platform out there. But it’s actually far more beneficial to choose a few platforms, and focus on creating the best possible content for them — in other words, don’t spread yourself too thin. It’s important that you track your social media performance to get an idea of what’s working, what isn’t, and what avenues you should go down. There are lots of tools out there that have been designed specifically to help you with this. For more information, check out SocialPilot’s round-up of the best social media analytics tools. With analytical tools, you can identify the social media platforms you get the most engagement from and monitor traffic, reach, and other metrics that tell you what kinds of posts are well received and what isn’t quite working. Having these tools at your disposal can help you make better decisions so you don’t end up wasting your time on platforms that won’t get the results you’re looking for. 4. Harness the power of a project management tool to keep track of your tasks As a freelancer, you can often be working on tons of projects for different clients. It can be hard having to juggle and keep track of so many details while ensuring nothing slips through the net. Using a project management tool can help you keep track of all your work, deadlines, and clients’ feedback. It’s also a great way to boost your productivity and keep you in control of all the different aspects of your projects. Here are some tools that have been specifically designed to help you manage your projects effectively. Trello If you have an extensive clientele list and have to perform repetitive tasks, Trello is a great project management tool choice. It allows you to track any number of projects from the beginning to the completion stage. With this tool, you can monitor every detail regarding a particular project, such as the associated files, links provided by clients, as well as media and marketing copy. The tool also has an easy-to-use interface that is simple to navigate. Google Suite Most people use one Google app or the other in their daily tasks, but you may not know that Google Suite is a great option for your basic project management needs. For example, Google Docs and Sheets allow you to plan and work on projects while sharing your ideas with other collaborators. There’s also Google Drive that makes it easy to store and organize all of your files while sharing them with others when necessary. Asana Asana might work best if you are a freelancer with team members. It allows you to assign tasks and set due dates for everyone so you can keep track of the deadlines for each project. 5. Collate any research you do with marketing templates Marketing can involve a lot of research that you’ll want to use to inform your strategies over time. Using marketing templates to organize and collate all of this research can be very helpful, as it will ensure you have all of the most important information in one place. There are many different types of marketing templates that you could use, including backlink gap templates, content strategy templates, content brief templates, and keyword research templates to mention a few. Marketing templates are very useful as they help you save time. Instead of coming up with a new method every time you embark on a project, templates give you a structure that can help you to organize your content marketing efforts. And you don’t need to create these templates from scratch. Companies like Loganix have ready-made SEO templates that will help you to stay on top of things and organize all of your research for when you really need it. 6. Use a graphic design tool to create visuals quickly and easily Marketing is becoming increasingly visual, so most freelance marketers will be required to do some graphic design during their work. There are a number of simple and affordable tools that have been created to help you with this. And many of them are easy to use so you don’t need to spend an exorbitant amount of time trying to create graphics. As a freelance marketer, these tools can help you create visual designs like images for social media, logos, infographics, thumbnails, and more. An example of a tool that can be used to make stunning visuals is Venngage or Picmaker. It will provide you with more than 100 templates that allow you to create catchy and interesting infographics that can be used on social media or websites. Their templates are also very easy to customize and tweak. You don’t need any professional training to make great designs, but this tool will make it look like you’ve spent years practicing. Summary Investing in the best tools as a marketing freelancer is essential to your success. The right tools will help streamline your processes, save you time, and monitor your marketing performance.

You have to manage multiple clients, stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends, and track the results of your work. This can get overwhelming but, if you have the right tools and resources, you can save yourself time, stay on top of things, and get better results. To help you successfully manage your workload and thrive under pressure , Alex Ratynski, founder of online marketing consultancy Ratynski Digital has shared his list of six powerful tools and resources that will make your life as a marketing freelancer much easier. fff 1. Eliminate the guesswork with time tracking software As a freelancer, it can sometimes be difficult to make sure you get paid what you are owed. One of the best ways to ensure you do is with time-tracking software that calculates how much time you’ve spent on a particular project.","content_length":926,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"6 great tools and resources for Marketing Freelancers","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/6-great-tools-and-resources-for-marketing-freelancers","essay_date":"Oct 13, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"There are lots of benefits to using a tool like this.

An avid drawer with over fifteen years experience, Ethan currently teaches art through an Irish youth organisation, passing on his skills and passion to the next generation. He has now teamed with Alison to spread his knowledge globally by producing an exciting new course entitled How to Draw. The course is the ideal starting point for budding artists seeking to learn drawing skills, one of the fundamental building blocks for artists interested in any medium. From an understanding of the materials to the finer points of technique, this course covers everything. Ethan spoke to the Alison Blog about how he started drawing, what fascinates him about the skill, and why he’s excited to share what he has learned with others. Hi Ethan, tell us a bit about yourself. My name is Ethan Moran. I’m 21 years old and I live in Galway, Ireland. I’m interested in all sorts of art and media but I’m particularly captivated by drawing. How did you get into drawing? I remember about the age of 5 I started tracing the line drawings from my colouring books onto separate sheets of paper by holding them both up to the window. After a while of doing this, I began to research drawing on YouTube. I watched every drawing tutorial and drawing-related video in the hopes of getting better and one day being able to draw like the people in the videos. It went from simple cartoons to human line drawings and then on to realistic renders of the human form. The deeper I went, the more love I had for the subject, and this continued to push me to strive for more. Are you self-taught or how did you learn to be an artist? Yes, I am self-taught. I tried going to drawing and painting classes but found they weren’t for me. I understand that for some people the structure of a course is very helpful, however I like to experiment myself and gain skills and knowledge through trial and error. What is it you enjoy about being a portrait artist? I enjoy being a portrait artist because it gives me a good outlet for my drawing abilities. It’s also a very interesting experience to draw someone as you look at them for hours and hours and try to recreate them on a page. It’s as if you get to know them without ever speaking to them. Portraiture is a constant challenge, no two drawings are ever the same and I really like that. Have you had any experience teaching? Yes, I am currently working with a youth organisation called Foróige. My role is to help the kids explore art through different mediums and get them to enjoy themselves. This can be anything from self-portraits done with pencil to clay modelling or even outdoor murals on walls. What is it you enjoy about sharing your knowledge and skill? I find sharing my knowledge to be very rewarding. There’s obviously always going to be some children who have no interest in art and that’s perfectly OK, but it’s when you see the one or two that try it out for the first time, enjoy it and come back for more that you really feel like you’re making a difference. It’s amazing to think that through advice and patience you can impart a skill to somebody, help them develop it and that it may go on to change their life. Why would you recommend getting in to drawing? I would recommend learning to draw because it has changed my life. Even from a young age I found it to be a fantastic outlet. It really provided focus. Once you pick up a pencil you constantly strive to get better. Once you commit and put the effort in you can really impress yourself and gain a level of skill you never thought was possible. I truly believe that everyone has the ability to draw, it simply depends on variables such as the amount of time you have available to commit, how you learn, and how much you want to learn. If you take the time, find a way of learning that suits you and genuinely want to learn how to draw, then you will learn how to draw. Drawing can be both thrilling and relaxing. It can be both frustrating and fulfilling. Through all the hiccups along the way, I have found learning to draw to be the best journey I have ever undertaken. What’s the hardest skill to master when it comes to drawing? I feel the hardest skill to master when it comes to drawing is finding your own style. I see many artists who simply copy the styles of others, add a slight twist and then are content to call it their own. The real challenge when it comes to art is creating something that is uniquely yours, something that people look at and say “Wow, I’ve never seen something like that before”. This truly is the most difficult part. Learning to draw can be a linear process but learning and creating your own style is a journey of self discovery that only you can undertake. What was it like creating courses with Alison? Creating the course with Alison was a great experience. It has taught me things like time management, course structuring, and video editing. I feel like Alison is a fantastic platform to share all the tips that I have learned with budding artists. The staff and everyone behind the scenes were also super friendly and helpful which made it a very easy project to undertake. The course I have created has modules and lessons based around everything from the basics of pencils to the advanced drawing of realistic images. I’ve incorporated every little trick I have to help escalate your drawing abilities faster than you ever could have imagined. What are you working on now? I’m currently restoring some life-size religious statues for a local church. I’m doing everything from sculpting to painting. It’s a phenomenal experience and I’m learning a lot along the way. What plans have you for the future, both as an artist and as a teacher? My plans for the future are unclear if I’m honest. I intend to teach art and drawing classes in person, restore more statues, and maybe create a few of my own along the way. But right now I’m just going with the flow and trying to enjoy myself the best that I can.

Accountants need to be able to balance books, electricians need to be able to wire plugs, and salespeople need to be able to make a pitch. But there are other skills that are required in all industries, regardless of your job, and your career won’t progress unless you have a solid foundation in these key areas. However, because these skills are common to all jobs, sometimes people can forget how vital they are and take them for granted. We’ve put together a list of these essential skills to make sure that you’re career has a rock solid foundation, whatever your industry. Diploma in Operations Management No matter what sector you work in, clinical operations management skills are vital to keep everything running smoothly. In this course you’ll learn how to juggle all the various elements of the modern business and how to maximise productivity and output. Operations management skills don’t just improve life within the workplace. Improved operations mean that customers receive good and services faster and have a better experience of your company. Diploma in Workplace Safety and Health Health and Safety are two paramount concerns for every workplace. While the dangers to be avoided and the precautions to be taken are unique to each work environment, an attitude of vigilance and a conscientious habit of always being up-to-date with safety procedure and protocols are necessary in every profession. This course outlines both specific circumstances to watch out for and general rules to follow and will guarantee that you both stay healthy and remain safe. Diploma in Project Management A must for every career, and absolutely essential if you plan on pursuing a promotion for a managerial role. Great Project Management skills are universal among those who climb the professional ladder. It’s not just about overseeing that the task at hand is carried out correctly, it’s also about coordinating all the individual players involved, making sure that deadlines are respected and guaranteeing that the client is satisfied with the outcome. Diploma in Customer Service Without great Customer Service skills, your career options are going to be severely limited. Whether you’re selling a product or marketing a service, if you cannot handle clients correctly and in a way that leaves them satisfied, then you’re not going to be an asset to your company. Customer Skills are also applicable to all the other people you interact with in a work environment, such as colleagues and managers, so mastering these skills will have a positive ripple affect on your career. Diploma in Human Resources One of the biggest mistakes in professional development is the idea that Human Resource skills are only for those in the HR department. Having the social and emotional intelligence that comes with quality HR training is a fantastic asset, regardless of your industry.

However, with so many advertising channels now available, it can be a struggle to make your brand stand out among the noise. And with so much consumer data available to businesses these days, tailored advertising means it’s harder than ever to get your share of potential clients’ attention. To effectively capture an audience and build a successful brand, it’s vital that your visual identity and your design strategy are coherent and client-focused. When it comes to achieving this, the key to success is the consistent understanding and application of Design Thinking. Design Thinking – Putting People First Design Thinking is a visual strategy founded on two vital ideas: Putting design at the heart of everything you do as a brand. Putting your customers at the heart of everything you design. Design Thinking is about implementing People-Centred Design and it’s crucial to cultivating an effective visual identity. It’s about keeping the client at the centre of your design efforts from the conception of your product to your marketing of it, and everything in between. With an increasing number of consumers looking for an “experience” when they purchase goods and services, more and more brands are upskilling in Design Thinking. This holistic approach to marketing teaches that you shouldn’t just design your visual identity with a view of simply leading customers to your product. Rather your visual identity should be a client-centric focus in-and-of-itself. Your visual identity needs to be something that potential clients can identify with immediately. It’s no longer enough to build a visual identity for your product that highlights its positives or showcases how it is superior to market rivals. You need to design an identity that focuses on the customer’s wants and needs. Research Your Market Design Thinking teaches that in all your design efforts, your focus should be on the potential client as much as it should be on the product, if not more. This school of design requires in-depth design research into your potential consumer base. The successful implementation of People-Centred Design must begin with rigorous analysis, testing and research into your brand’s would-be clients. You should be asking: What kind of visual story will your target audience want to be told about themselves? How does your target audience see your product in their life? What is the visual identity of your target audience? Learn from Your Target Audience This final question is key and one that often goes overlooked. When a brand is trying to forge a successful design strategy, it always has a plan readily available to it in the form of the visual identity of its target audience. This is why Design Thinking places such an emphasis on customer research and analysis.

But then life gets in the way. If you think saving money is difficult, you’re not alone! According to a 2017 survey by GoBankingRates, 46% of people have no savings at all! Yes, savings can be tough, but sometimes, all it takes is that first step in the right direction that will get things moving the way you want it to. These 10 practical tips can help you take control of your finances and save more! 1. Create a budget Instead of trying to recall where your whole month’s salary went, write it all down before your expenses begin. A budget should tell you where the money needs to go, rather than where it all went. Make a financial action plan for each month and stick to it. 2. Pack lunches for work Over a weekend, make a meal plan for the next week. By shopping according to your plan, it will cut down those little food expenses that crop up during the week. Cooking your own meals is not only good for your pockets, but your health as well. Commit your cash towards a healthy diet, and save! 3. DIY – Do It Yourself Be it for beauty treatments, or fixing a broken wall clock at home, the internet is filled with so many DIY tips! DIY is basically things that you can do yourself at home, rather than paying someone else to do it. Gaining new skills + Saving money = A win-win! 4. Grocery shop smart Shopping smart means knowing the prices of different stores, buying things only when needed, and stocking up for the whole week. By creating an effective shopping list and avoiding psychological traps (like buy one and get another for half price), you will save quite a few bucks. You can even take it a step further by growing your own greens, instead of buying packaged vegetables! 5. Exercise at home You’re into physical fitness and have a gym membership, great! But there are other ways to exercise and save money. From Yoga to regular fitness routines, you can accomplish your fitness goals from the comfort of your home. 6. Compare insurance House, car, life – whichever type of insurance you have, don’t just renew it every year. Once in six months or a year, take some time out and shop around to see if you could be getting better rates with a different company. 7. Have a financial goal One of the best ways to save money is to set a goal. Having a goal like investing in a house, or paying off your debts, can keep you focused towards saving money. Each time you spend you will think of your end goal, which will motivate you to cut down on unnecessary expenses. Each time you save, you will know exactly what you’re saving for, keeping your end goal on track. 8. Pay in cash Studies show that people tend to spend more when using a credit or a debit card because it doesn’t give them the sense of excessive spending. When you carry cash, you will stick to spending whatever you have in your pockets. When this becomes a habit, you will plan your expenses ahead of time and carry limited cash based on your needs, giving no room for unnecessary expenses. 9. Pick the right tools to save money Research and choose finance tools that suit your goal, to help you get the highest interest rates from your savings. For example, if it’s a short-term savings goal, a savings deposit account can lock in your money for a specific time period. If it’s a long-term goal, securities such as stocks or mutual funds might work for you. 10. Seasonal smart shop Buy things when they are least in demand, for the best price. For example, buy cold-weather clothes in Summer, and vice versa. January is the best time to buy Christmas decorations, and November is a great shopping month with Black Friday deals. Avoid buying jewellery during the Christmas season when it’s more expensive than usual.","length":3837,"tokens":848,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"10 Practical Tips to Save Money Everyday","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/10-practical-tips-to-save-money-everyday","essay_date":"Sep 17, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Most of us would like to save money, whether it’s for a new car, new home, your child’s education, a holiday, or just a rainy day fund.

Disruptive technology, pandemics (!), shifts in consumers habits, all of these can result in sectors having to rethink how they operate. These industrial reorganisations can have knock-on effects at every level of the business, including supply chains, marketing and, of course, hiring. Over the last twenty years, a consistent trend across almost all industries has been the growing frequency of freelancers. In part, this can be attributed to automation resulting in businesses needing less hands on deck 24/7, and instead bringing in experts on a need-by-need basis.

Now, more than ever, teachers have had to dig deep to fulfil their uniquely important role in society. From managing health and safety in the classroom to motivating students to learn from behind a screen, teachers have been tested in ways they never thought they would be. Remote learning hasn’t just brought school into the family home, it’s also brought the home into the classroom and teachers have had to negotiate family dynamics and gain a fast understanding of the diverse and different environments that their students come from. At Alison we’d like to thank teaches the world over for their work – from one educator to another. To show our appreciation, we’ve put together a list of 5 incredible courses to aid you in the coming school year. Managing Safety and Health in Schools In any school or workplace, safety is everyone’s priority. This course will familiarize and prepare you for any crisis situation. You will be able to name and identify the various roles, duties, and responsibilities that make up a solid safety policy, learn about risk assessment, as well as describe and state the main components and features of a safety statement. This certificate course is a must for all educators and school administrators. Motivating Students to Learn Have you ever wondered what affects student motivation? Wouldn’t you love to have a class full of interested and engaged students who look forward to every lesson? An enthusiastic and motivated student produces better results. This 5 star rated course will expose you, as the teacher, to different motivation theories and will show you how to create a classroom environment that is stimulating and that promotes a highly motivated learning culture. Understanding Student Development and Diversity A teacher who fully understands that their classroom community comprises a diverse population differentiated by physical, cognitive and social development, as well as gender and cultural differences, will have a much more positive effect on their students. With this course, you will be able to distinguish between “learning” and “development”, understand the main factors involved in student development, and know the difference between the “staircase” and “kaleidoscope” development models. Effective Communication Techniques for Teachers and Trainers Do you want to know how to bring out the best in your students, even the shy, introverted ones? Effective communication is not just about making yourself understood verbally. Your non-verbal communication, such as your facial expressions and body language, goes a long way in helping students feel involved. This course assists you in your role as facilitator, mediator and deliverer of content, helping you to connect and interact with your students in a way that encourages maximum participation from everyone and which encourages stimulating discussions. Growth Mindsets for Teachers and Learners Having a growth mindset supports life-long learning and means that you believe your intelligence and talents can be developed over time, as opposed to a fixed mindset which believes that if you’re not good at something, then you’ll never improve. This course has been specially created to foster a growth mindset in teachers and students alike. Your classroom environment will be greatly improved if everyone there has a proactive and curious approach to both teaching and learning! Check out Our Transition Year Hub! We’re also delighted to anounce the launch of another great resource for teachers around the world. The Transition Year (TY) programme is an optional fourth year of secondary school in the Irish Education system. It’s a year in which students can study topics and gain experiences outside of the traditional curriculum.

Credit Analysts perform the vital task of making sure that the person their institution is loaning money to is creditworthy and will be able to pay the money back. The role comes with huge responsibility because one bad loan – if it’s big enough – can spell the end of a financial institution.

He’s played with a variety of outstanding traditional musicians over the years, including as part of both At First Light and At The Racket. He plays a weekly session in Tigh Coili in Galway and has just finished recording an album with Hugh Healy, a concertina player from Corofin in Clare, which will be out in the next few weeks. Michael has produced Alison’s Traditional Irish Guitar Courses and shared his passion for both the genre and the instrument with the Alison Blog. Hi Michael, tell us a bit about yourself! My name is Michael McCague and I’m from a small village in north County Monaghan called Scotstown. I play traditional accompaniment on the guitar and bouzouki. My parents started me and my siblings on traditional music lessons to give us an outlet and a hobby. I first started playing by learning tin whistle at the local Comhaltas group. Then when I was about 6 or 7 I started going for lessons on the fiddle. I took up banjo for a few years later but never really took to it. I took a bit of a break from playing music and then, when I was 16, in Transition Year, I remembered my cousin had this instrument with a funny sounding name and it turned out to be the bouzouki. He happened to be getting a new one so I bought his old one, and that’s how I started accompanying. He showed me a few chords and then I used to call round to him whenever he was home from university and he’d show me a few things and we’d listen to albums and try out different things. How did you get into playing the guitar? It really wasn’t until I got to college that I took up guitar. There was a guitar sitting around in the house I was renting so I used to pick it up and play a bit. I taught myself through translating my knowledge of bouzouki accompaniment and also from listening to records and playing in sessions. I knew a lot on the bouzouki by then in terms of chords and harmony and what chord progressions worked well for traditional music. I really just had to translate it onto guitar. How did your music career progress after college? I really wasn’t playing guitar that long when I started playing with a band called At The Racket. I had finished college and I used to play the odd session with Brian McGrath, who was the piano and banjo player in the band. He’s highly accomplished and much sought-after both as an accompanist and as a banjo player. He asked me to play a few gigs with them and that basically turned into me joining the band. So I started playing with them we’ve played a lot of traditional festivals and arts venues around Ireland and the UK. What’s different about the guitar in Irish traditional music? With the guitar, you have standard classical tuning or folk tuning, which is a tuning that lends itself to traditional music. You take the bass string and you tune it down from an E to a D. We call it Dropped D tuning. DADGAD [named after the notes the strings are tuned to] is another traditional tuning for guitar. With DADGAD you have a potential for the notes to ring out more and have more sustain than with Dropped D, so there’s a looser sound to DADGAD and a tighter sound to Dropped D. How did the guitar become integrated into traditional Irish music? The guitar was being used in traditional Irish music as early as the 20s and 30s in recordings in New York but really it took off with the folk boom in the 60s. Paul Brady was an early forerunner. He was the first person to start playing Dropped D tuning. Arty McGlynn was another early exponent. Then you had people like Mícheál Ó Domhnaill who was one of the early DADGAD players. Though it’s still not a mainstream instrument, the guitar is engrained into Irish music now, primarily in an accompanist rhythm role. Why do you love Irish music? I would have considered myself quite shy when I was younger and traditional music really brought me out of my shell. It’s a great way to get out and about and meet people and develop your personality. It’s a very open and accepting community to play music in. Traditional music is informal and it’s a simple music in some ways. It’s not very complex in terms of moving through keys and modulations, like jazz or classical music. But it’s got very involved melodies and you have to be very aware of different people’s styles and be fit to adapt and join in in sessions, whether you’re a melody player or an accompanist. While it’s not very complex harmonically, it’s very melodic music. It’s an aural and an oral tradition and there are lots of different ways tunes can move and that’s so much scope for variation. That’s where the challenges in Irish music lie. There’s great freedom in it that way. Why would you encourage others to learn your instrument? Playing traditional guitar is fulfilling because you’re providing a really interesting backdrop to the melody players. Sometimes players might be nervous so you have to provide them with a steady rhythm to give them safety and comfort. And then sometimes you might give them a jolt, and provide them with ideas or a jumpstart. You’re providing them with support and also inspiration with the different variations in rhythm or chords that you play, so there’s a reward in bringing out a lot of stuff that’s inherent but subtle in the music. And it’s a challenge too because there’s no set template for chords in Irish music. It’s not like pop music where the melody is written and then the chords are charted out. In traditional music the tunes are written or handed down and you just have to find a way to provide the harmony or the chords. It’s a totally open template so there’s great freedom in that but also great challenges in how you establish what your chords are and what your arrangement is. You’ve got a lot of freedom with Irish music. Why would you recommend learning Irish music to people? There’s a good community of people in Irish traditional music. They’re very non-judgemental. There are also lots of different instruments to try out and you don’t have to have a specific role in the music. You don’t really have lead or backup. At a session, you can play along with lots of different melody players so if you’re not quite sure of yourself, there’ll always be stronger melody players there who can keep the melody going if you’re only starting to learn. It’s a very welcoming music and it’s not too complex or daunting. It can be quite hard to get involved in some music genres, unless you start your own band. But with Irish music you can always go and join a local session group. It’s a living music.

He plays a weekly session in Tigh Coili in Galway and has just finished recording an album with Hugh Healy, a concertina player from Corofin in Clare, which will be out in the next few weeks. Michael has produced Alison’s Traditional Irish Guitar Courses and shared his passion for both the genre and the instrument with the Alison Blog. Hi Michael, tell us a bit about yourself! My name is Michael McCague and I’m from a small village in north County Monaghan called Scotstown. I play traditional accompaniment on the guitar and bouzouki. My parents started me and my siblings on traditional music lessons to give us an outlet and a hobby.","content_length":850,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Michael McCague: “There’s great freedom in Irish music.”","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/michael-mccague-theres-great-freedom-irish-music","essay_date":"Aug 24, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"I first started playing by learning tin whistle at the local Comhaltas group. Then when I was about 6 or 7 I started going for lessons on the fiddle. I took up banjo for a few years later but never really took to it. I took a bit of a break from playing music and then, when I was 16, in Transition Year, I remembered my cousin had this instrument with a funny sounding name and it turned out to be the bouzouki. He happened to be getting a new one so I bought his old one, and that’s how I started accompanying. He showed me a few chords and then I used to call round to him whenever he was home from university and he’d show me a few things and we’d listen to albums and try out different things. How did you get into playing the guitar? It really wasn’t until I got to college that I took up guitar.","content_length":802,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Michael McCague: “There’s great freedom in Irish music.”","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/michael-mccague-theres-great-freedom-irish-music","essay_date":"Aug 24, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"There was a guitar sitting around in the house I was renting so I used to pick it up and play a bit. I taught myself through translating my knowledge of bouzouki accompaniment and also from listening to records and playing in sessions. I knew a lot on the bouzouki by then in terms of chords and harmony and what chord progressions worked well for traditional music. I really just had to translate it onto guitar. How did your music career progress after college? I really wasn’t playing guitar that long when I started playing with a band called At The Racket. I had finished college and I used to play the odd session with Brian McGrath, who was the piano and banjo player in the band. He’s highly accomplished and much sought-after both as an accompanist and as a banjo player. He asked me to play a few gigs with them and that basically turned into me joining the band.","content_length":873,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Michael McCague: “There’s great freedom in Irish music.”","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/michael-mccague-theres-great-freedom-irish-music","essay_date":"Aug 24, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"So I started playing with them we’ve played a lot of traditional festivals and arts venues around Ireland and the UK. What’s different about the guitar in Irish traditional music? With the guitar, you have standard classical tuning or folk tuning, which is a tuning that lends itself to traditional music. You take the bass string and you tune it down from an E to a D. We call it Dropped D tuning. DADGAD [named after the notes the strings are tuned to] is another traditional tuning for guitar. With DADGAD you have a potential for the notes to ring out more and have more sustain than with Dropped D, so there’s a looser sound to DADGAD and a tighter sound to Dropped D.","content_length":673,"content_tokens":158,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Michael McCague: “There’s great freedom in Irish music.”","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/michael-mccague-theres-great-freedom-irish-music","essay_date":"Aug 24, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"How did the guitar become integrated into traditional Irish music? The guitar was being used in traditional Irish music as early as the 20s and 30s in recordings in New York but really it took off with the folk boom in the 60s. Paul Brady was an early forerunner. He was the first person to start playing Dropped D tuning. Arty McGlynn was another early exponent. Then you had people like Mícheál Ó Domhnaill who was one of the early DADGAD players. Though it’s still not a mainstream instrument, the guitar is engrained into Irish music now, primarily in an accompanist rhythm role. Why do you love Irish music? I would have considered myself quite shy when I was younger and traditional music really brought me out of my shell. It’s a great way to get out and about and meet people and develop your personality. It’s a very open and accepting community to play music in.","content_length":872,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Michael McCague: “There’s great freedom in Irish music.”","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/michael-mccague-theres-great-freedom-irish-music","essay_date":"Aug 24, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Traditional music is informal and it’s a simple music in some ways. It’s not very complex in terms of moving through keys and modulations, like jazz or classical music. But it’s got very involved melodies and you have to be very aware of different people’s styles and be fit to adapt and join in in sessions, whether you’re a melody player or an accompanist. While it’s not very complex harmonically, it’s very melodic music. It’s an aural and an oral tradition and there are lots of different ways tunes can move and that’s so much scope for variation. That’s where the challenges in Irish music lie. There’s great freedom in it that way. Why would you encourage others to learn your instrument? Playing traditional guitar is fulfilling because you’re providing a really interesting backdrop to the melody players.","content_length":815,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Michael McCague: “There’s great freedom in Irish music.”","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/michael-mccague-theres-great-freedom-irish-music","essay_date":"Aug 24, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Sometimes players might be nervous so you have to provide them with a steady rhythm to give them safety and comfort. And then sometimes you might give them a jolt, and provide them with ideas or a jumpstart. You’re providing them with support and also inspiration with the different variations in rhythm or chords that you play, so there’s a reward in bringing out a lot of stuff that’s inherent but subtle in the music. And it’s a challenge too because there’s no set template for chords in Irish music. It’s not like pop music where the melody is written and then the chords are charted out. In traditional music the tunes are written or handed down and you just have to find a way to provide the harmony or the chords. It’s a totally open template so there’s great freedom in that but also great challenges in how you establish what your chords are and what your arrangement is.","content_length":881,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Michael McCague: “There’s great freedom in Irish music.”","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/michael-mccague-theres-great-freedom-irish-music","essay_date":"Aug 24, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"You’ve got a lot of freedom with Irish music. Why would you recommend learning Irish music to people? There’s a good community of people in Irish traditional music. They’re very non-judgemental. There are also lots of different instruments to try out and you don’t have to have a specific role in the music. You don’t really have lead or backup. At a session, you can play along with lots of different melody players so if you’re not quite sure of yourself, there’ll always be stronger melody players there who can keep the melody going if you’re only starting to learn. It’s a very welcoming music and it’s not too complex or daunting. It can be quite hard to get involved in some music genres, unless you start your own band. But with Irish music you can always go and join a local session group. It’s a living music.

JUST Creative works with entrepreneurs and businesses who want to strategically build a brand that cuts through the noise and delivers a clear goal-focused message, with a consistent visual style. A strong believer in the value and accessibility of online learning, Jacob has been a lifelong learner his entire career and encourages all budding designers to be the same. He currently teaches through both his blog and his coaching programme. Jacob spoke to the Alison blog about his industry experience, how to get ahead in design and his advice for learners. Hi Jacob, tell us a bit about yourself! Hey! Jacob Cass here! I love helping designers, entrepreneurs and experts make money doing what they love through branding, design, marketing and business smarts. As for me, I am a brand designer, strategist, educator, podcaster, business coach, community builder and the founder of JUST Creative, a design consultancy that doubles as an industry-leading blog (and passive-income machine!). I’m classically trained as a graphic designer but have been deeply involved in the design and branding industry since 2007. Along with a Bachelor in Visual Communication from The University of Newcastle, Sydney, you also hold a Brand Master Certification from Brand Master Academy. How have you found your own experience of online learning? Online learning has been part of my education since the very beginning and still is today. I learn from online course providers as well as blogs, podcasts and everything in between. Online learning has exploded in the past few years, which has been both good and bad. On one hand, we have more teachers and knowledge, however the quality varies dramatically because “everyone’s a teacher”. In some courses, I haven’t got past the first module and others have provided paradigm shifts that have totally changed the trajectory of my career. Through your JUST Branding Podcast and your Inner Triangle Coaching Program you teach designers, entrepreneurs and creatives how to grow their brands. What inspired you to be not just a brand designer, but an educator in brand design? Looking back on my career as a designer, it’s clear to see that I’ve always been an educator. Earlier in my career, I was educating through writing but more recently that has shifted to educating via audio, as well as live through one-on-one coaching and group coaching. As an experienced educator, what advice do you give your students that would also help Alison Learners? Never stop learning. Life is a continuous journey of education. If you have a subject that you love, go all in and educate yourself from multiple sources. Take courses from different teachers as they will have their own unique knowledge to share, and amplify your learnings by reading books and actually putting what you learn into ACTION. Action is everything. You included Alison’s Visual and Graphic Design course on your list of the 10 Best Free Graphic Design Courses Online. How did Alison come up on your radar and what prompted you to include it in your list? I came across Alison when researching free graphic design courses on Google and I was impressed with the knowledge that was being given away for free so I just had to share your course on our list. The modules covered the basics of design and it wasn’t overwhelming for those just getting started. What are the most important skills to learn to become a successful graphic designer? At minimum, a successful designer must know the principles of effective visual communication aka what makes “good design”, as well as the process of how to effectively achieve this. Particular areas that I believe designers should master are the core design principles, typography and color theory. Soft skills are crucial as well. This comes with practice but often way too late in one’s career. By soft skills I refer mainly to people skills – learning how to get to the root cause of people’s problems, how to sell your services, how to negotiate and so much more. You’ve previously worked for some huge global brands, such as Nike and Disney, and are now focusing on working with smaller businesses to grow their brands. What prompted this change, and how rewarding do you find working with entrepreneurs? For five years, I worked in advertising agencies in New York who had Fortune 500 companies as clients, and that’s where I cut my teeth in the industry. This taught me a lot about branding, design, advertising and how to apply my skills in the real world. The shift to small businesses happened when I left New York to travel the world. I explored over 60 countries over 3 years and during this time I started running my design agency and the JUST Creative blog which focused on smaller businesses. You’ve said that you believe design to be “a lifelong journey of continuously honing your craft” and that you encourage other designers and entrepreneurs to continue to always learn. How do you always make sure that you continue to learn and upskill professionally? What you put in is what you get out. If you consume garbage, your output is going to be garbage. Learn from the masters, from people who’ve been there and have the results to prove it. Don’t just consume either. Put what you learn into action as that’s how you will continue to learn and upskill professionally.

It’s not something you can get a degree in or pass a test to prove you have it. But employers know it when they see it and they value it above almost every other skill an employee can possess. Time is money in every industry and so productivity translates into profit. Upskilling to become more productive across a wide range of tasks adds up to make you a much more efficient employee in general. When you maximise your time to get the most out of it, your employer will notice that you manage your workload more successfully than others. This makes productivity one of the key attributes for earning promotions because employers want the efficient people running the show and teaching others how to be equally as productive. By taking these five courses, you’ll be taking the first steps towards a well-earned promotion! Why Do Later What You Can Do Now? Having the skills required to successfully complete a task is only half the battle to getting things done. Equally as important is the motivation and willpower necessary to get things done promptly and efficiently. Learning to Beat Procrastination will have an immeasurably positive knock-on effect on your career because you’ll find that you not only have more time to get things done, but you’ll have more brain space and energy to devote to your other tasks.

Countless hours are wasted over the course of a week simply because most employees have never actually taken a course in this fundamental skill that they use everyday! Saving Time by Writing Minutes! Taking Meeting Minutes is vital for the successful running of a business because it provides everyone with an accurate record of decisions taken and plans agreed. It facilitates moving forward as much as it documents what has already taken place. Minute taking can be a tricky business in a high octane meeting and so being able to quickly and correctly take down what is being discussed and decided is a skill that will mark you out as an exceptionally efficient employee. Know Your Tools No matter how well you think you know the software you use on a daily basis, you should always seek out new ways to use it more effectively and productively. This not only increases your personal capacity to work more efficiently, it makes you the workplace expert in a vital area. If you’re the one your colleagues go to with questions about how they can improve their performance, then you’ll stand out for your employers.

The day is about taking some time to mark the friendships that define our lives and to actively celebrate the joys of friendship. It’s been a difficult 18 months for everyone and we’ve all relied on our friendships even more than usual to get us through the difficulties of the pandemic. This Friendship Day, why not do something different to recognise and strengthen your relationship with a friend by signing up to an online course together? Learning is always easier and more enjoyable when you can do it with a friend, and a shared project is a great way to bring people closer together. Learning with a friend is not only a fantastic way to celebrate your friendship, it’s also a successful way to learn as you can keep one another motivated and inspired. So to mark International Friendship Day, we’re recommending five exciting courses to help you celebrate your nearest and dearest! Physical Fitness Maintaining the motivation to stay fit and in shape can be a real struggle. This is definitely an area where buddying up pays dividends. Both in the long term of sticking to your routine and achieving your fitness goals, and in the short term of having someone to push you on while you’re actually exercising, having a friend on board makes getting fit much easier. Exercising also gets the endorphins flowing and working together physically as a team is a proven way to bring people together. Not only will you be getting healthier, you’ll be becoming even closer as friends! Languages The best way to learn a language is to speak it, speak it, speak it! There’s no substitute for actually using the vocab you’re acquiring. By learning a language with a friend you’ll greatly improve your language acquisition because you’ll always have a willing conversation buddy at hand. Practicing a language when you’re a beginner can be daunting and so it’s understandable to be reluctant to practice with native speakers. By undertaking the project with a friend, you’ll have someone to practice with who’s not just on the same level as you, but is someone who you already feel comfortable with. Photography Photography is an exciting hobby that can also, with a bit of practice, become a lucrative part- or even full-time job. However, it’s a deceptively dense subject to tackle and so studying with a friend is a great way to spread the workload. You can also exchange photos easily online to trade tips and share your progress. Sometimes taking photos can be a lonely pursuit but by learning with a buddy, you’ll be able to spend some quality time together while out searching for the perfect picture. Social Media Marketing Starting an online course with a friend isn’t just an opportunity to take up a new hobby. It’s also a great way to upskill professionally in a dynamic and interactive way. Learning a new skill to augment your professional toolkit is always a great way to use your time. Social media skills are transferable and applicable to nearly all sectors, so they’ll be of benefit to you and your friend regardless of your industries. This is a great course to take with a friend because not only can you study it remotely, you can also test out your new skills remotely too. Communication Skills Communication skills have always been crucial to a successful career, and always will be. If you’re socially adept in the workplace then you’ll have an immeasurable headstart over those who either can’t get their ideas across or are too self-conscious to communicate them effectively. Upgrading your communication skills in tandem with a friend is a great learning strategy because you’ll be able to try out what you’ve learned as you’ll feel comfortable together. Feeling at ease is essential to being able to communicate freely and effectively and so learning with a friend is the ideal way to tackle this vital course.","length":3902,"tokens":817,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"International Day of Friendship: Courses to Study with a Buddy!","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/international-day-friendship-courses-study-buddy","essay_date":"Jul 29, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"The 30th July is the United Nations’ International Friendship Day.

Since her earliest days, she has been immersed in seannós singing – the ancient singing tradition of the area. Nell’s mastery of her art has seen her recognised as one of the country’s top seannós singers. From taking prizes at Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann in 2005 and 2006, to being named Musician of the Year at TG4’s Music Awards in 2012, Nell’s dedication to her craft has seen her win a host of accolades. Since 2016, she has been a member of Danú, the highly respected and long-running Irish traditional group. Nell’s expertise and commitment to keeping seannós singing alive and well make her the perfect teacher for Alison’s Seannós Singing Courses. She spoke to the Alison Blog about why she started singing and why you should too! Hi Nell, can you tell us a bit about yourself and your musical background? My name is Nell Ní Chróinín and I come from a small village called Ballingeary in the Múscraí Gaeltacht in County Cork. The Gaeltacht areas are the pockets all over Ireland where the Irish language is spoken on a daily basis. It was my first language growing up and I was always interested in the language. When I started singing, all my songs were in Irish, which is natural for seannós singing. The term seannós means “old tradition” and that’s essentially what it is. It’s the oldest singing tradition we have in this country. It’s hundreds and hundreds of years old. Both my parents sing and I started singing from a very young age. There’s a very strong seannós singing tradition in Múscraí and so it was always around me when I was growing up. I heard lots of really well known local singers singing in the seannós style so, to me, singing acapella – unaccompanied – was never something that was out of the ordinary, even though it’s not very common generally. Muscraí is obviously very important to your musical heritage. Can you tell us a bit more about its seannós singing tradition? Múscraí has a strong tradition of seannós singing, even more so than the tradition of music. Sometimes if you’re at a session and if somebody sings on their own, people mightn’t listen. But in Múscraí, there’s a lot of respect for the songs, with singers taking centre stage before musicians. Growing up I went to sessions and heard and witnessed singers singing on their own. Diarmuid O Súilleabháin was a great singer from Múscraí who died the year I was born. A festival was set up in his honour, which is mainly based around singing, and I used to go to it every year. It was great because you got to meet singers from all over the country. While there are lots of different styles of seannós, I grew up singing in the Múscraí style. When I was young, there was a scheme set up called Scéim Amhránaíochta Aisling Gheal (the Aising Geal Singing Scheme), which was set up to encourage local children to sing the local songs and to preserve them because we have such a strong tradition of local seannós songs and songwriters. I started going to the lessons when I was about ten years of age and my teacher was Máire Ní Chéilleachair, who’s a very well-known and well-established seannós singer. I went to these free singing lessons every week until I was about 17. They weren’t formal lessons like you’d have in classical styles of singing. Instead I got to learn about the history of the songs and about the locality because a lot of the songs were written locally and were about the area. I’m glad I had the classes because I think I needed that formal weekly structure of learning the songs. That teaching scheme is still going today. They’re still teaching the local songs to kids as young as 9, which is great. How did your musical career develop from those early days? While I was taking the lessons, I was also entering competitions like the Fleadh Ceoil and Oireachtas na Samhna (traditional Irish music competitions) and winning under-age competitions, which helps get your name around the place. I liked going to festivals because you’d meet singers you’re own age which encouraged me because it was good craic. By the time I stopped going to the lessons, I had sung at a couple of local festivals and people were interested in my singing, so I got asked to sing at more and more events. I just continued singing at festivals and building a bit of a reputation for myself. How did you end up becoming a professional musician? When I went to college in Limerick I did primary school teaching, I didn’t actually study music. I was involved in both the Cumann Gaelach and the trad society there and we had weekly sessions where I’d always sing a few songs. On the weekends, I’d go to festivals, sometimes as a guest. As I got older I was asked to teach workshops and then, when I was in my early twenties, I was asked to sing on a CD with a band called the Raw Bar Collective. We recorded an album live in a pub and that was my first release. Then in 2016, I was asked to join the band Danú. By then I was teaching full time so I had to make the decision whether or not I was going to leave teaching. I just felt that if I didn’t take the opportunity, I’d have been raging with myself. I know everybody likes the security of a steady job but there was something in the back of my head that said that if I didn’t do it then, then I’d never do it. So I left teaching. What was it like joining such an established and well-known group as Danú? I was a huge fan of Danú growing up and they’ve always had really good singers like Ciarán Ó Gealbháin and Muireann Nic Amhlaoibh. They’ve always respected songs in Irish, which are the majority of the songs I sing. It was a big transition for me because seannós singing is obviously acapella so I’m used to performing on my own. Going from that to performing with five other lads on stage was a bit of a change but I adapted. The lads made me feel very comfortable and they were very respectful towards the songs which is something that I’m very passionate about – that the songs are arranged appropriately to suit the lyrics, the mood and the voice. Because I didn’t have much experience of singing with accompaniment, the musicians were following me, rather than me following the music. It’s really collaborative and I’m really enjoying it. We haven’t performed together since last March but I’m looking forward to hopefully getting back on the road with them again soon. What is it you love about seannós singing? I think that singing is a very personal thing. Not that playing music isn’t, but with singing you can’t hide behind your instrument. Your voice is your instrument. I might sing a song today, and I might sing it again tomorrow but I might not be feeling as good so I’ll never sing the song the same way. It changes from day to day depending on how you’re feeling. When I’m listening to a singer, I love hearing the stories of the songs. In Irish, you say abair amhráin – “tell a song” – because you’re telling a story. It really catches you as a listener when you can hear the emotion of the song coming across when the singer is telling the story. It really makes for an effective singer if you can tell the story from the point of view of the person that wrote it. Why would you recommend learning seannós singing to people? For me, there is so much life and soul and heart in Irish songs. You can’t help tapping your feet to the fast tunes and, at the same time, you can be brought to tears by the slow airs and the sad songs. Another reason is that Irish traditional music is such a small world and the singers and musicians are so welcoming and generous with their time. Seannós singing is an ancient oral tradition and it’s it’s our tradition that we’re proud of as Irish people. And we don’t want to see it die out so you want to ask people to join in in a session and encourage the younger generation to keep it alive. When you sing a seannós song, you’re taking part in an ancient tradition.

As an Irish company, Alison is proud of Ireland’s rich musical heritage and is excited to offer these free courses to our growing community of over 20 million Learners worldwide. The project has been spearheaded by Doireann Ní Ghlacáin, a presenter on the Irish TV station TG4 and a highly respected fiddle player. Besides coordinating this unique project, Doireann is also the subject matter expert responsible for the Irish Fiddle courses. Doireann is delighted for the opportunity to share her unparalleled knowledge of her instrument with Alison’s millions of Learners. A fiddle player almost as soon as she could walk, Doireann Ní Ghlacáin has stellar Irish heritage credentials and is passionate about all aspects of the culture. Her maternal grandfather is the famous composer and arranger Seán Ó Riada who is acknowledged as a giant of the 1960s Irish music revival, while her paternal grandfather, Tom Glackin, was an accomplished fiddle player from Donegal. He taught his children the instrument and they passed the skills on to Doireann and her talented siblings and cousins. As she says herself, “Music is very much the family business.” Although Doireann plays fiddle in the Donegal style, and retains a strong connection to that north-western county, she was brought up in Dublin where her father, Kevin Glackin, played a key role in the capital’s resurgent traditional music scene. Doireann’s mother, Dorcha Ní Riada instilled in her a love of language. She came from Cúil Aodha (Coolea), a village in the Múscraí (Muskerry) Gaeltacht region of Co Cork, and so Doireann was brought up as a Gaeilgeoir, or native Irish speaker, and, as you might expect, as a singer. “My mother nurtured a love of sean nós singing in us and we spent our childhoods between Dublin and Cúil Aodha, where I learned the songs from the area.” Unsurprisingly, Doireann’s life has revolved around performing and teaching the fiddle and she tours regularly with concertina player Sarah Flynn. They recorded an album, The Housekeepers, in tribute to the great women of the Irish musical tradition, and have performed from China to the USA and all over Europe. An appearance on the national Irish language TV network TG4 a few years ago led to her becoming a presenter and she’s now a familiar face to viewers. She hasn’t neglected her own education, however, and has a degree in Irish and History, a Masters in Irish Literature and is currently doing a PhD in Irish and Ethno-Musicality, focusing on the songs of the Muskerry Gaeltacht. When commissioned to create this suite of Irish Traditional Music courses exclusively for Alison, she called concertina player and camera man Liam O’Brien and the pair worked closely on the project, with Liam recording the videos. “We knew we wanted the top musicians in their field and that’s what these courses provide that is unique. The teachers are all young musicians at the top of their game. I love to sit down and listen to their music. As fellow musicians we were able to work together and make sure the lessons were accessible to learners.” All of the subject matter experts behind the courses are experienced teachers in their respective instruments. “That’s the lovely thing in Irish traditional music. You’ve been taught for years and then when you master your craft, you go and teach it to others. Whereas in other art forms it’s very much about you, in Irish traditional music you are aware of being a link in the chain. You learn it from somebody and you pass it on to the next generation. All the teachers are very aware that we’re just bearers of the tradition and we must pass it on to the next generation as best we can and while being as truthful to the tradition as we can.” “I love the vision of Alison in regards to these free courses and the learning of music – that it is a joy of life, and everyone should have access to learn how to play musical instruments without respect to their financial circumstances.” Start your journey into Ireland’s musical heritage by checking out the Traditional Irish Music Hub now!","length":4221,"tokens":946,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Launching Alison’s Irish Traditional Music Courses!","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/launching-alisons-irish-traditional-music-courses","essay_date":"Jul 28, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Alison is delighted to announce the publication of our free online Irish Traditional Music courses, produced by some of Ireland’s most talented musicians.

You’ve been taught for years and then when you master your craft, you go and teach it to others. Whereas in other art forms it’s very much about you, in Irish traditional music you are aware of being a link in the chain.

Motivated by her medical expertise and her belief in the universal good of free education, Eurika took part in the Alison Coronavirus Course Translation Project last year, translating the life-saving course into Zulu. As well her great work on the online learning front, she has also been a frontline worker throughout the pandemic. Eurika has helped and inspired both her local community and her country through her tireless work over the last 18 months and she has been recognised with a number of national awards. She continues to combine her medical knowledge and belief in online learning by promoting healthier living through education. She spoke to the Alison Blog about her remarkable year. Hi Eurika! You’ve had a busy year since you took part in our Coronavirus Course Translation Project last summer. Can you tell us a bit about what you’ve been up to? It’s been such an exciting year since I translated Alison’s free online Covid-19 course. Since that time I was awarded a Golden Key International Honorary Society Alumni Award for 2020, in honor of the role I played as a frontliner during the pandemic. I was busy with my church, New Creation Embassy led by Apostle Peter Jones, donating to over 6000 families in the Mpumalanga Province. We had amazing supporting partners and it was such a thrilling and eye opening experience. Since then I’ve also received more awards and am currently practicing as a Colon Hydrotherapist and Counselor at a local Homeopathy Medical Centre in Nelspruit. I’ve also been nominated for the South African Heroines Award for 2021. The past year has surely been a huge blessing and with much more still coming up! You were featured on Expresso, South Africa’s most-watched morning show, where you mentioned Alison’s free online courses. How important has online education been to your journey? Online education played such a huge role for me because I was able to work a 9 to 5 job while still studying my passion – Medical Sciences and Patient Care through Psychology and Counseling. I also had to make use of my Business Management and Journalism studies to help fund my study journey. Being able to study online taught me time management skills, along with fostering a lot of discipline to consume the necessary information, while understanding that I would be tested on this data once I was working in the field. Online learning became a huge factor when the pandemic hit, and more people are starting to adjust. This year you became an ambassador for the SPAR Women’s Challenge. Can you tell us a bit about the project? What role does education play in it? The SPAR Women’s Virtual Challenge is a virtual race that people can sign up to from anywhere in the world. The aim of this virtual challenge is to unite women all around the world and to empower them to make the most of their gifts and passions. This year’s theme is #LiveLimitless. I was selected as an Ambassador and my job is to educate women about taking care of themselves, along with understanding basic health care needs. We are also raising funds to buy sanitary pads for young girls from disadvantaged communities. Through this we will be able to help many young girls, while offering Menstrual Education support for those girls who have to miss school because of their cycles. We are out to break stigmas! How did it feel to be chosen as one of the Mail & Guardian 200 Young South Africans of the Year? When I found out that over 5000 young South Africans had been nominated for the award I was in awe. Sincerely, I felt so honored to know that out of all of those individuals, I was one of the few who are being honored with such a huge accolade. It was an unexpected award. I felt really grateful to be celebrated for doing what I love the most. I thank the Lord for allowing me to make the much needed contributions that are helping to change other people’s lives. What can people learn from your personal story? When asked by people, “How did you manage to do all these things?” I tell them that when you have been set apart for something big in this world, you may try to hide it or avoid it. But understand that it will be brought out into the public because it’s meant to help and benefit many others. Knowing that out of nothing, the Lord made me into someone great is a huge honor that I will surely never take for granted. Your nomination for Young South Africans of the Year cited your interest in online education as a means of helping make healthcare more widely available. Can you share your thoughts on that? Online education helps change our perceptions on a number of topics, including health. By exploring online courses, you can become fully equipped to combat life’s challenges. Through online education, people are able to study basic nutrition or counseling that will assist in laying a foundation for them to grow and stay healthy. Once they are given the practical information, they become fully aware of what they are dealing with. This pandemic has taught us that we need to get as many people to understand what happens in their body as possible. Through health care courses like those offered by Alison, people have learnt to listen to their bodies. With this incredible public platform you’ve been given, what message about education would you like to endorse? Education is not the only key to success, but it surely helps you to find the right doors and it also gives you an advantage in knowing how to open those doors. There is so much information out there, it’s important to get the right data. That is why I spend a lot of time volunteering my skills to help online learning institutions like Alison to ensure that we get the right information to the people who need it. That is very important for us. Knowledge is key to me because it helps guide your response to difficult situations. Whether it’s textbook knowledge or knowledge acquired through association – knowledge makes you better.","length":6010,"tokens":1244,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Dr. Eurika Mogane: “Online education helps change our perceptions on a number of topics, including health.”","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/dr-eurika-mogane-online-education-helps-change-perceptions-number-topics-including-health","essay_date":"Jul 21, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Dr. Eurika Mogane is a doctor and Alison student from South Africa.

Commemorating the life and work of Nelson Mandela, the day is about recognising his commitment to instilling equality, combating poverty and changing the world for the better. For us at Alison, Mandela’s legacy of tirelessly working to improve the lives of his fellow South Africans stands as both example and encouragement for our work in empowering people around the world through education. This year, we’ve chosen five free online courses to help inspire you to take action against poverty in your local area and implement positive social change in your community. Community Development Regardless of the issues facing your local community, before you can begin to tackle them together, you need to establish a strong sense of community spirit and solidarity. This sense of common project and identity is integral if your community is going to succeed in improving your shared situation. Alison offers a range of highly affecting courses in community building that will help you lay the groundwork for an energised and close-knit community that is ready to tackle challenges collectively. Childcare Childcare can be extremely expensive and quality services are in short supply. The lack of confidence in existing services, and the prohibitive prices of much good childcare, means that many parents’ professional lives suffer as they don’t have anyone to care for their children while they work. This means that their earning potential is limited and often results in both parents and children becoming caught in a poverty trap. Organising a Community Childcare Program can be an incredibly beneficial service that unlocks the full potential of your community and helps give families the tools they need to rise out of poverty. Community Gardens Whether your community is rural or urban, the benefits of setting up a community garden are exponential. From providing a social outlet for retirees, to offering young people a safe and productive outlet, a shared garden is a great way to engage all generations across the entire community. The mental health benefits of working with the earth are well documented. The project also has the potential to generate food for struggling families, while also providing a community industry in the form of a produce market, which results in both jobs and income. Fundraising Nobody knows your local community better than you do so the best tool you can have is one that puts resources at your disposal without any strings attached. Being able to raise your own funds so that you can direct them into the projects you know your community needs is a powerful asset for any community to have. Learning how to fundraise effectively will grant your community an independence that will be felt by all involved. It also helps emancipate struggling community members as it teaches them how best to generate their own funds collectively. Community Health Nothing is as integral to the success of a community as the health of its members. However community health can be a tricky subject to navigate, particularly when poverty can result in drastically different situations for different members. As ever, knowledge is the key to understanding and thus improving the situation. Alison offers a variety of courses aimed at explaining potentially divisive community health issues, from the opioid crisis to drugs in the workplace. A better understanding of these problems will result in a dialogue that can then seek to remedy these community health issues. Our course in CPR, defibrillators and First Aid is also required learning for all conscientious community members.","length":3671,"tokens":666,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Mandela Day 2021: 5 Ways To Take Action and Inspire Change","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/mandela-day-2021-5-ways-take-action-inspire-change","essay_date":"Jul 15, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Every year, 18th July is celebrated across the world as Mandela Day.

The mental health benefits of working with the earth are well documented. The project also has the potential to generate food for struggling families, while also providing a community industry in the form of a produce market, which results in both jobs and income. Fundraising Nobody knows your local community better than you do so the best tool you can have is one that puts resources at your disposal without any strings attached. Being able to raise your own funds so that you can direct them into the projects you know your community needs is a powerful asset for any community to have. Learning how to fundraise effectively will grant your community an independence that will be felt by all involved. It also helps emancipate struggling community members as it teaches them how best to generate their own funds collectively.","content_length":1016,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Mandela Day 2021: 5 Ways To Take Action and Inspire Change","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/mandela-day-2021-5-ways-take-action-inspire-change","essay_date":"Jul 15, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Community Health Nothing is as integral to the success of a community as the health of its members. However community health can be a tricky subject to navigate, particularly when poverty can result in drastically different situations for different members. As ever, knowledge is the key to understanding and thus improving the situation. Alison offers a variety of courses aimed at explaining potentially divisive community health issues, from the opioid crisis to drugs in the workplace. A better understanding of these problems will result in a dialogue that can then seek to remedy these community health issues. Our course in CPR, defibrillators and First Aid is also required learning for all conscientious community members.","content_length":731,"content_tokens":127,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Ivy Makoni: “Alison opens the door to education for everyone for free.”","url":"https://alison.com/blog/ivy-makoni-alison-opens-door-education-everyone-free","date":"Jun 21, 2021","thanks":"","content":"Ivy Makoni is an Alison Learner based in Pretoria, South Africa. Besides being an Alison graduate, Ivy also runs the highly successful Facebook group, Alison Students in South Africa, which helps over 3,000 Learners with all their Alison-related queries. Originally from Zimbabwe, Ivy’s incredible story of triumphing over adversity through education makes her a fantastic role model for the thousands of Learners she helps empower themselves through Alison Students in South Africa. Ivy spoke to the Alison Blog to share her inspiring story. Hi Ivy, tell us a bit about yourself! My name is Ivy Makoni and I’m 33 years old. I was born and raised in Zimbabwe. When I was 5 years old, I was orphaned when I lost my parents in a car accident. I was raised by my uncle until I finished high school. However he had 6 children of his own to take care of and so he didn’t have the money to finance my going to university. I moved to South Africa to look for a job so I could raise the money to pursue my studies and achieve my dream to of becoming a nurse. It was really hard at a young age to move and look for a job as a house-maid, but I had no choice. How did you learn about Alison? I first heard about Alison through my boss’s daughter, for whom I had started working as a maid in South Africa. I had told her about my dream of one day becoming a nurse. At the time, on my days off on the weekends, I used to go to a private clinic where I was training in caregiving and helping patients with dementia. She gave me her laptop to research how else I could make my dream a reality and I found Alison. When I told the Sister in charge of the clinic about Alison, she advised me to choose the Diploma in Clinical Nursing Skills as my first course so that I could upgrade my knowledge and continue my journey towards becoming a nurse. She offered to let me come and apply the theory I had learned with Alison in the clinic. I would study all night on Alison using my boss’s daughter’s laptop and then, in the morning, I would do my cleaning duties. On the weekend I would apply what I had learned. When I finally completed my Diploma in Clinical Nursing Skills, I was so proud of myself that I was progressing towards my dream of one day becoming a nurse. What inspired you to create the Alison Students in South Africa Facebook group? I was inspired to encourage others to empower themselves with Alison because of my experience of growing up without any money to go to university and of pursuing my dream of becoming a nurse. Others like me might not have any money to enroll in a university but Alison opens the door to education for everyone for free. Tell us about Alison Students in South Africa and the work you do. The Facebook group, Alison Students in South Africa, now has over 3,000 members and we are attracting new members every day. When I started my journey with Alison, I thought I was the only one. But when we created this group we found there were thousands of others studying with Alison in South Africa. We want to spread the word further and encourage newcomers to enroll with Alison for free. The group has been incredibly helpful. Hundreds of students get in contact with us who want to know more about studying with Alison or have questions about their studies. There are so many different courses on Alison; the group allows students who have questions on a specific course or topic to ask the community and get an answer from someone who has already taken the course and has the right information. I’m an Admin for the group and I also answer many of the students who want to learn more about nursing. I encourage them to pay for their Alison Certificate so that they can use their knowledge to secure practical experience in hospitals and clinics. I also approve members and posts and make sure they’re only concerned with studying with Alison. I have to block all the scammers and the irrelevant posts that don’t apply to learning! How have Alison courses affected your career? Alison courses have advanced my nursing career because, thanks to my Alison training, I was chosen as one of the nurses at the clinic to train as a Covid-19 vaccinator. I qualified and got a Certificate from the South African government so that I could start vaccinating my community. It’s been a very scary experience, being placed on the front line. As a vaccinator, I was one of the first to get the vaccine to protect myself from Covid-19. Due to my Alison diplomas and my practice at the clinic, I have achieved my dream of working as a nurse. Your story so far has been incredible. What’s next for you Ivy? In terms of education, I would love to keep on upgrading myself and learning more to become a pediatric doctor. I am still studying with Alison to empower myself further and have recently earned the Diploma in Nursing and Patient Care. I’m looking forward to pursuing this new dream. I’m planning on next enrolling in the Pharmacy Technician Diploma, as well as gaining a certificate in Community and Institutional Pharmacy. In terms of working, I want to keep helping my community by working as a vaccinator at our local clinic. I also want to continue to uplift others by encouraging them to enroll with Alison and to pursue their dreams. What would you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? I would recommend Alison because I am where I am today because of Alison. It helped me turn my dreams into a reality. Alison is creating universal standards of education based on what someone knows and not based on where they got their diploma.","length":5563,"tokens":1173,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Ivy Makoni: “Alison opens the door to education for everyone for free.”","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/ivy-makoni-alison-opens-door-education-everyone-free","essay_date":"Jun 21, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Ivy Makoni is an Alison Learner based in Pretoria, South Africa.

For those entering third level institutions for the first time, this means that the summer will be spent in the same way would-be students have always spent it: trying to find accommodation, researching your new university and maybe even a last minute change to your preferred courses. But with the pandemic receding, it’s also likely that travel will be much more open next year. This means that the option of a gap year, or a year out, is on the table for many high school graduates. Gap years can be incredible opportunities to take a break after the stress of your final year exams, and before third level learning begins. But you can also capitalise on that “time out” by spending your year travelling and having fun, while also improving your CV and gaining invaluable life experience. We’ve put together five great courses that will give you a taste of some of the most rewarding and beneficial ways to spend your gap year. Volunteering If the last year has taught us anything, it’s compassion and perspective. For those lucky enough to go to university, volunteering on your year out to help those less privileged is a great way to both exercise that compassion and reinforce that perspective. There are countless fantastic causes and organisations that are always seeking eager, committed and hardworking individuals who are keen to make a difference. Teaching English If you’re proficient in English then the world is your oyster! By gaining a certificate that proves that you’re qualified to teach English as a second language, you open countless doors for both travel and work opportunities. Whether you’d prefer to work with children or adults, there’s always a huge demand for English languages teachers around the world, from summer schools to community centre English classes. Teaching English abroad is also a great way to immerse yourself in a new culture! Working on Organic Farms A great way to travel the world and learn invaluable life skills is by working on organic farms. There are various well-established organisations who facilitate these working holidays safely and transparently. Working for your bed and board on the farm, you’ll find your part of the family in no time! As well as being a great opportunity to learn about the food we eat, where it comes from and how it should be treated, working on organic farms is also a fantastic way to meet new people from all over the world. Tour Guide Becoming a tour guide offers endless opportunities: the chance to travel, learn and meet new people. Whether you’d like to show people around your home town or use it as a way to learn more about a place you’re keen to visit, being a tour guide is the perfect way to socialise while also getting to expand and exercise your knowledge. If you’ve already decided what you’d like to study in university then you can give yourself a headstart by becoming a guide somewhere relevant to your future studies. Au Pair Gap year students have a long history of au pairing and there’s a reason it remains so popular. Besides being a cheap and easy way to travel, you’re also guaranteed to have a lot of free time while the kids are at school. Working with young children can be incredibly rewarding work and many au pairs end up forming life-long bonds with the families they stay with. If you know that you enjoy working with kids, or are considering a career in teaching, then au pairing is a great way to spend a year out.","length":3563,"tokens":736,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"How Will You Spend Your Gap Year? 5 Options that Look Great on a CV","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/will-spend-gap-year-5-options-look-great-cv","essay_date":"Jun 4, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"With the world slowly returning to normal, it seems like next year’s academic year will go ahead much the way they used to.

The skillset needed to succeed in a particular field changes every year as technology evolves, and the role of automation continues to grow. This means employers constantly need to adapt the part played by their staff in making their business a success. For the employees of today, the one-track career path is a thing of the past. In such a dynamic employment landscape, workers are expected to flexible and be prepared to learn a new skill whenever necessary. The work environment is now also a learning environment, one in which upskilling is part and parcel of the job. As members of the workforce constantly retrain and broaden their abilities, being open to learning will no longer set you apart from your peers in the job market. It’s no longer enough to be a learner, you need to be the right kind of learner. Know How to Learn At Alison, we’re not just experts in teaching, we’re experts in learning. Deciding to take an online course in order to improve your CV or upgrade your earning potential is only half the battle. In order to maximise the benefit of our free online courses, you need to develop an Intentional Learning Mindset. Many people in today’s job market struggle to learn the new skills required of them because they don’t know how to learn. An Intentional Learning Mindset is an approach to learning which sees you live as you learn and learn as you live. Unlocking this mindset allows you to approach learning as a holistic experience that, instead of feeling daunting, seems natural. Equally, it means that you integrate learning into your everyday experience. An Intentional Learning Mindset isn’t just an approach to Alison, it’s an approach to life! As the jobs market continues to evolve, this attitude to learning is becoming increasingly important to employees who are required to be evermore adaptable and willing to retrain. Here are six ways to develop your Intentional Learning Mindset and future-proof your career. 6 Ways to Develop an Intentional Learning Mindset (with free courses!) Every Moment is a Learning Opportunity Every moment is alive with learning opportunities and being able to harness this potential means you’re always open to engaging new ideas and taking in new information. Mindfulness and zen are two excellent practices that allow you to centre yourself and take in the moment, and harness its potential. An Intentional Learning Mindset isn’t just about actively engaging with learning material, it’s about cultivating a disposition which sees each moment as a learning opportunity and is able to capitalise on it. Growth is Always an Option Cultivating Intentionality allows you to fully engage in the task of learning. This is the vital first step but it needs to be twinned with an equally engaged attitude focused on results. This is where a Growth Mindset comes into play. A Growth Mindset means that, while you’re learning, you’re always intent on expanding your capabilities and growing your skillset. You focus on the building of experience and the practice accrued, rather than focusing on what you haven’t yet learned or the difficulties that come with acquiring new knowledge. A Growth Mindset means you always think of your learning journey in terms of progress. Discard Distractions Fundamental to fostering an Intentional Learning Mindset is the belief that the act of learning has an inherent value and thus requires commitment. In order to fully take in the material you’re learning, you need to deliberately think about what you’re doing. Trying to learn while splitting your attention means that you’re not respecting the skill you’re aiming to learn. You’re also frustrating yourself because you won’t learn at the rate you could if you devoted yourself fully to your studies. Intentional Learning means distractions go out the window! Regular Achievable Goals Intentional Learning requires commitment and can be a difficult mindset to master and equally hard to maintain. To encourage your commitment to the task at hand, it’s vital to set yourself regular, manageable goals so that you can chart your progress while also marking your achievements on your learning journey. This provides encouragement and inspiration, both of which make it easier to stay committed. Committed Learning = Committed Practice Intentional Learning should lead to Intentional Practice, which should then lead to Intentional Working. Translating education into concrete work experience can be difficult and is often where many students struggle. While a teacher can help you learn information, it’s up to the student to put it into practice effectively. Growing your critical thinking skills is crucial for turning your learning into action. By critically diagnosing your work situation, you can identify how to apply your newly gained knowledge in a way that boosts your performance while also improving the functionality of the workplace. Feedback is Part of the Learning Journey Learning doesn’t stop once it’s been put into practice. An Intentional Learning Mindset is a holistic approach to gaining knowledge and is applied at all moments. However, sometimes knowledge can only be gained from without, and if you’re applying a new skill in the workplace, it’s going to be observed by your peers and managers. The likelihood is that the application of your new skillset is going to be able to be finetuned. To continue learning, it’s important to reach out to those around you for feedback so that you can adapt your newfound knowledge and continue to advance. Asking for and receiving feedback can seem overwhelming, so building your confidence and self-belief are central to developing an Intentional Learning Mindset.","length":5721,"tokens":1166,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Future-Proof Your Career: Develop an Intentional Learning Mindset","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/future-proof-career-develop-intentional-learning-mindset","essay_date":"May 18, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"The world of work is always evolving.

The inception of Alison in 2007 as a social enterprise marked a radical shift in online learning. Motivated by Article 26 of the UN’s Declaration of Human Rights (“Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free.”), Mike and the Alison team created an online learning platform that offered free education to people all over the world and which was both sustainable and scalable. Now with over 20 million learners and 3.5 million graduates, Alison is a world leader not just in education, but empowerment. Our 2,500+ courses have enabled millions of people around the world to rise above their circumstances, to choose and pursue their own life path, and to achieve the goals they’ve set for themselves. Hi Mike, tell us what inspired you to choose a career in education? I’ve always believed that education underpins all human advances, whether that be political or economic, social or personal. Quality education is the cornerstone on which positive change is built and unfortunately, it has remained the privilege of a relatively small percentage of the world’s population. I founded Alison with the goal of bringing quality education to anyone who needed it, regardless of income, background, or any other factor. Education is unique among progressive forces in terms of the disproportionate size of its positive effects. A little learning goes a long way. Whether as a teacher or a provider of free online learning, education remains the best way for an individual to have the best chance at changing the world. What’s your single proudest achievement in the education sector? My proudest achievement in education is founding Alison. I say that not just because of the sheer number of people we’ve empowered but because we were pioneers in the sector. When we started Alison, there was no one else providing free education like it. I had no lead from anyone else that it was possible, I had to figure it out for myself. I believed that you could provide free quality education through a sustainable and scalable model paid for by advertising and that the social impact could be massive. I’m proud of having seen the opportunity and having gone for it, and for having done it because it was the right thing to do. When I graduated from Harvard I could have gone into Wall Street but I wanted to do something more socially-focused. You’ve got to do something meaningful with the time and the talent that you have. Alison hasn’t just helped millions individually, we also set the benchmark by showing people what was possible. What has been the most important development you’ve witnessed in education in your professional lifetime? The internet, hands down. Not just because of the breakthroughs in communication it has enabled but because of the free flow of knowledge and skills that has been made possible via these new communication tools, and the incredible changes that it has led to. The access to resources the internet has provided has allowed countless people to enhance their personal capacity endlessly. The internet is unequalled in terms of what it has done to enable and empower people. Why is free education so important in addressing global inequality? There’s so much inequality in the world. The statistic I repeat ad nauseum is that only 7% of the world’s population have ever been to college. People in the western world grossly overestimate how educated the world is and how accessible education really is. Free education is vital in order to empower masses of people at scale, equally, regardless of income, race, sex or gender. Not only are millions of people being denied their right to an education, but at the same time, there are employers struggling to find people qualified to carry out jobs across a number of sectors. There’s a huge shortage of people for jobs and yet there are so many people around the world who could be doing this work if only they were empowered through education and free workplace skills training. Why do you think that online learning has been such a game changer when it comes to democratising education? It comes down to the cost of delivery: with online learning, education can be free, or rather, online you can enact a model by which advertising facilitates free education. Because free education isn’t actually free, it’s paid for by the learner’s value as a consumer and their potential purchase of a product or a service. This online model is already driving educational costs to zero and allows for all knowledge to become freely accessible and instantly available. We want to be a champion in making this potential happen. Just because something is possible does not mean it will automatically happen. What in your opinion is the most pressing educational issue globally? Unfortunately it’s the strength and resistance of the status quo in the education sector itself. People tend to underestimate just how huge a business education is (approximately $5 trillion per annum, according to UNESCO 2020) and how protected it is by people who want no change in the status quo. Teachers often have the very purest motivation, but behind them are management and often investors who see a balance sheet and not an education scorecard. While many politicians want to increase access to education, they’re surrounded by people who are bought and paid for by the education industry and who, while they’ll talk about how they want change, don’t want to see any real change whatsoever. At Alison we’re driving down costs across the industry and putting knowledge out for free digitally. We know that by upsetting the old market we can create a new, much larger market of people accessing education who’ve previously been excluded. If you were to recommend one online course to our Learners, what would it be and why? Touch Typing is invaluable for all online or computer-based work. Over the course of your professional life it will save you months of time and, so often at work, it’s only 5 minutes that can make the difference! What advice would you give to Alison’s Learners who are using free online learning to empower themselves? Always keep learning. Education never stops, regardless of age or qualifications. By continuing to empower yourself, you also empower those around you – family, friends, community. The positive ripples of education are endless.","length":6455,"tokens":1289,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Alison Anniversary Interviews: Mike Feerick","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-anniversary-interviews-mike-feerick","essay_date":"May 6, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Mike Feerick founded Alison on the principle that anyone, anywhere should be able to learn anything, at anytime, for free.

The Breteau Foundation believes that every child, regardless of location or background, should have access to a quality education. Since its inception in 2013, the Breteau Foundation has implemented a range of educational initiatives that today reach 25,000 children. The foundation also empowers hundreds of teachers through their teacher training programs which provide educators with the digital skills necessary to bring forward the next generation. Through its network of partner schools across 10 different countries, as well as through refugee settlements and daycare centers, the Breteau Foundation is providing quality digital educational tools to some of the world’s disadvantaged children Hi Sébastien, tell us what inspired you to choose a career in education? Education is the stem of everything. My parents were teachers and I relate very much to the act of mentoring/coaching/passing on knowledge. When I was a teenager, I provided Mathematics tuition to a young girl, who found it very challenging. She persisted and after completing an assessment and gaining a high result, I could really see a change in her self-esteem. I found that a fabulous moment of humanity, when you are able to help someone and you see their progress and improvement. I founded the Breteau Foundation with a view of helping disadvantaged primary school children, providing them with tablets, high quality educational content and providing training to the teachers who support them. What’s your single proudest achievement in the education sector? Sadly, global education is not equal. Bringing our programme to the world’s most disadvantaged children is a small step in helping to give children everywhere, regardless of their background and location, an opportunity to succeed. Today, we now have 25,000 children enrolled in our programmes. What has been the most important development you’ve witnessed in education in your professional lifetime? The most important development I have witnessed is the quality and diversity of digital technology innovation and the role it has played in enhancing learning. Technology is continually evolving and providing opportunities to improve learning experiences for children. With more educational apps, tablets and mobile devices, children have more interactive and engaging ways to learn which, as we have seen with the children that we work with, motivates them to want to learn and improves their chances of completing education. Why is free education so important in addressing global inequality? Education provides freedom and dignity. Where children and adults cannot access education, there is lower educational attainment and fewer opportunities to build a career or a sustainable future. Free education allows anyone from anywhere in the world, no matter their background, to have the same opportunities. This increases their chances for a better future and enables individuals to play a bigger role towards building a stronger community. Why do you think that online learning has been such a game changer when it comes to democratising education? For those who do have connectivity, online learning improves access to resources, knowledge and learning. For some countries, switching to online learning has been a tremendous help during the global pandemic. Unfortunately, for the majority of the communities we work with, online learning is not a possibility and without access to this, these children are significantly worse off. Our initiatives directly address connectivity inequality such as our offline Homeschooling Tablet Programme and our Mobile Education bus in Lebanon which brings education to refugee children. We also have offline Educational apps available in local languages and printed academic workbooks that are distributed into communities so learning can continue. What in your opinion is the most pressing educational issue globally? Learning poverty. Pre-Covid, learning poverty was already high, with many children in middle to low income countries not being able to read at a basic level by age 10. Currently, the World Economic Forum has reported that an additional 72 million children will be pushed into learning poverty. We need to be on the front-foot with education and find alternative ways to continue learning for these children. If you were to recommend one online course to our Learners, what would it be and why? We have recently partnered with Learn to Be a Better Human (LTBABH), an online e-learning platform that allows you to access micro classes for personal and professional development whilst also giving back a percentage of profits to charities. With LTBABH, we are developing a series of micro-classes that feature children we work with in the countries that our programmes reach. We have just launched our first micro-class ‘Friends Around The World: South Africa – Cape Town’ that aims to develop empathy and to help others understand how children in other countries live their lives. Our micro-classes are a valuable way to learn about someone else’s culture and their day-to-day lives in places that many of us may not have the opportunity to visit. What advice would you give to Alison’s Learners who are using free online learning to empower themselves?

Learning Equality’s pioneering offline-first platforms have reached over 6 million learners in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. From rural schools to orphanages, community centers to refugee camps, Learning Equality focuses on fostering effective education technology interventions in marginalized contexts. Hi Jamie, tell us what inspired you to choose a career in education? I’ve always had a passion for learning, and in particular always loved taking on and practicing new languages. In my academic work, I was driven by curiosity about the learning process itself and began my graduate school work in Cognitive Science doing experiments around grammar acquisition. I quickly realized that I wouldn’t be satisfied doing basic research and wanted to more directly increase access to quality education, so I began translating this research into building ed-tech solutions. What’s your single proudest achievement in the education sector? I’m most proud of co-founding the non-profit organization Learning Equality, alongside like-minded friends who were eager to build a more equitable and just world. When we started back in 2013, we saw education technology gaining momentum and were excited about the potential for leveling the playing field. But with most of the world still not on the Internet, we were deeply concerned about how inequitable access to these new opportunities was actually further widening the opportunity and achievement gaps. So we dedicated ourselves to creating new tools, technologies, and approaches that could enable effective use of education technology without reliance on Internet connectivity. Seeing this small organization grow over the years to what it is today, reaching millions of offline learners and attracting an array of incredible professionals united in this common vision of providing quality educational opportunities for the half of the world that still doesn’t have access to the Internet, is beyond what I dreamed of when we first embarked on this journey. What has been the most important development you’ve witnessed in education in your professional lifetime? I believe the increasing awareness around open education, and the widespread adoption of open educational resources (OER) and open-source software by individuals and governments across the globe, has been one of the most important developments in education in the past two decades. To achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal on Education, and create a truly equitable global educational landscape, I believe we need to focus on fostering a truly open educational model: creating quality, openly licensed educational resources that can be freely shared, downloaded and reused under Creative Commons licenses, developing open tools for alignment of these resources to curricular standards, challenging biases on current learning engineering practices by helping researchers and policy makers have access to open, anonymized data from disconnected and marginalized environments, and, finally, fostering more professional development opportunities for teachers to be upskilled on blended learning practices that leverage these open resources. Why is free education so important in addressing global inequality? Education is a powerful force for enabling opportunity and social mobility, yet millions around the world lack access and are unable to escape a vicious cycle of poverty that persists across many generations. Educational opportunities have always been deeply intertwined with privilege and, despite efforts over the past few centuries to universalize access, huge gaps in equitable outcomes persist across geographic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Without continued proactive efforts, these disparities will continue to persist and widen. While providing educational materials or tools for free is not sufficient (and must be coupled with the right types of support and distribution), it is a key ingredient in the overall solution. Why do you think that online learning has been such a game changer when it comes to democratizing education? Democratizing education by enabling quality, free educational opportunities is a critical component in addressing poverty-related global inequalities. Digital innovations are exciting for many reasons, including the way they open up new modes of interaction and experiential learning, but in particular because of their ability to scale, especially when coupled with open licensing that allows for their free distribution and adaptation to a wide range of contexts. However, it’s important that we don’t see technology as a silver bullet. While education technology has the potential to help scale solutions, with nearly half the world still lacking access to the Internet, we must acknowledge the barriers imposed by inequitable access to connectivity, hardware, support, and quality educational opportunities across the world, including here in the USA, and continue to build coalitions that work together to break these cycles and overcome these barriers at a systemic level. What in your opinion is the most pressing educational issue globally? Upskilling teachers and educators across the globe around blended learning practices is an incredibly timely issue. When the pandemic hit, we all witnessed how unsupported and unprepared teachers felt when they had to suddenly shift to online, distance learning. Conversely, we also saw some amazing examples of resilience from teachers across the world, who went above and beyond their own means to ensure the continuity of learning for their students. A teacher’s role is extremely difficult, time-consuming, and undervalued, and yet arguably the most important job in the world. So providing them with the tools they need to succeed, especially around the use of technology for teaching, is paramount. While many people look to education technology to replace teachers, we believe that it works best when it is leveraged to amplify the role of the teacher, freeing up their time and attention to best support students who are struggling. If you were to recommend one online course to our Learners, what would it be and why? While you should always follow your passion and curiosity, one of the most powerful skills I learned was how to program. The Python programming language, in particular, has been a powerful tool for me in so many areas of my work and life, from building education technology platforms, to automating my workflows and saving myself time, to analysing large sets of data. Even if you’re not planning to pursue a career focused on IT, learning Python can be a really valuable tool to have in your belt. What advice would you give to Alison’s Learners who are using free online learning to empower themselves? Learning is best when it’s social and communal. Particularly during the pandemic, when we have become further isolated, I believe finding ways to connect with others and build community around learning has become even more important. I encourage you to find ways to build connections and learn together, while also paying it forward and helping others to succeed.","length":7437,"tokens":1333,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Alison Anniversary Interviews: Jamie Alexandre","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-anniversary-interviews-jamie-alexandre","essay_date":"Apr 27, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Jamie Alexandre is the co-founder and Executive Director of Learning Equality, an education technology non-profit focused on creating and supporting open source tools to enable equitable access to quality educational opportunities for learners and educators with limited or no Internet access.

O’Genius Panda, the company’s flagship educational platform, was selected by the UN Sustainable Development Solution Network as one of most innovative global youth-led solutions for advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. O’Genius Panda allows students to perform science experiments remotely and thus gain valuable practical knowledge. The platform is accessible anytime, anywhere through digital devices and, over the last year, it has become a cornerstone of the Rwandan Ministry of Education’s remote learning programme, allowing thousands of children to access high quality education for free during the pandemic. Hi Origene, tell us what inspired you to choose a career in education? The motivation for my career was based on the challenges of my personal experience. During my time at secondary school, I spent the first three years without any access to digital technology and without access to materials that we needed to understand some of the courses we were taking. We were without access to the resources that would have helped us excel. That always resonated with me and I wondered how I might change the status quo. Then I went to university and I remember, in my first month, we were studying in the workshops. Now the resources were all there but no one was telling me how they worked. We were studying, theoretically, those things which I should already have been familiar with. I could see I was at a disadvantage and it made me think about how my schooling might have been different. I started thinking about how technology might be used to resolve some of these issues – the scarcity and expense of certain learning materials, the lack of digital learning content, the issue of accessibility. When our company began working on the product O’Genius Panda, 78% of secondary schools in Rwanda still didn’t have access to science laboratories. Yet these schools were still teaching science subjects. The students were graduating without getting the chance to enter the lab and were then supposed to pass the national practical examination in science. It just wasn’t fair. Some students walked to better schools just to be able to conduct some experiments but how often can they be expected to do this and how much are they really learning under such conditions? So the motivation was, how do we make quality educational resources accessible to everyone across the nation? How can I use the skills that I have and the technology that I love to impact as many people as possible and for generations to come? What’s your proudest achievement in the education sector? There have been a lot of achievements. Right now our platform has reached over 20,000 learners across the nation. We’re reaching users from over 500 schools across all districts in Rwanda. This isn’t something we take for granted. Students who use O’Genius Panda have testified that it helped to increase their academic performance by 10% on average, compared to how they were performing before starting to use the platform. It’s also very inspiring for us to see that the platform has been visited by people from 109 countries across the world. During the pandemic period, the platform became one of the cornerstones for education in Rwanda. We were humbled to work in partnership with the Ministry of Education, the Rwandan Education Board and the Mastercard Foundation to advance accessibility and to make education available to all of the kids who needed it. The schools were closed for over 8 months but, through our platform, students could continue to learn and access materials as if they were still in school. Though they were in a homeschool set up, they could still learn and have access to teachers to support them and to a community in which they could share. It has really made an impact in terms of making sure that thousands of teenage students, who might otherwise be exposed to drug abuse or other distractions, could focus on learning and access a platform where they could keep up their studies. What has been the most important development you’ve witnessed in education in your professional lifetime? In a country like ours, which is still developing, there are so many things that are currently changing, but the biggest change is the one happening in mindset. You find that many people still don’t understand the role of technology in supporting children’s education, including teachers, parents, school representatives, even some students. You still find teachers who believe that the only way to deliver a class is by using chalk on a blackboard. You also find that some parents can’t believe that a kid can learn on a computer or on their phone and get the same quality of education that they could get when sitting in front of a teacher. I’m not undermining the presence of a teacher or of face-to-face learning but there are other alternatives that people can leverage. This shift in mindset in which parents understand that their child can learn from anywhere is really important. It has meant that parents have started supporting their kids by paying for subscriptions for certain educational resources and purchasing devices so they can keep up their studies. It’s been a fascinating shift because before, if you asked a parent to give their kid a phone, they’d only think in terms of social media or things that were going to distract them as opposed to focusing them on learning. But over time, they have accepted that there are alternative learning models that young people can access. I really advocate this model because when a young person is given access to technology at an early age, they don’t just use it to learn the skills that they are being taught but they also learn how to use technology effectively. If we look to the future, the skills that will be needed are mostly based on technology. We need to prepare young people so that they will be competent and know how to make technology work for them. Why is free education so important in addressing global inequality? I believe it’s important to support people who are coming from an underprivileged background to get a quality education so they can improve their lives. If you ask a parent in a rural area who is struggling to pay for health insurance for their child to pay tuition or to pay for an online resource, they’re not going to consider that. It’s not going to be one of their priorities. There needs to be support for people who are living in poverty-stricken or rural areas who need access to tools and resources to get an opportunity to learn. That’s where development partners need to come in so that these kids can have access to the materials that they need to shape their own lives. Why do you think that digital learning has been such a game changer when it comes to democratising education? Online education is a game-changer when you think of its scalability, portability, accessibility, flexibility, and affordability. These factors highlight the importance of digital learning and online resources versus in-place learning. Learning is longer defined by the four walls of the classroom. It can happen anywhere, as you can now access quality education without necessarily attending a classroom from morning to evening. The flexibility of this alternative is the beauty of technology. In countries like Rwanda, we have few qualified and trained teachers, who are only available in elite schools. How might it be possible that these teachers could reach as many young people as possible, without overwhelming that teacher and without asking the children to move around? This is possible through technology, as one teacher can now reach thousands of children. Technology plays a huge role in making sure there is an equal distribution of resources. What in your opinion is the most pressing educational issue globally? There is an issue with old-fashioned teaching styles and practices. You find that some of the ways people are teaching do not reflect how the current generation is willing to learn. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed by education systems as it hinders the motivation for learners. This goes hand-in-hand with the issue of some teaching materials not being up-to-date. If a curriculum remains static and isn’t updated, then this affects the skills that learners are graduating with. If an education system is not dynamic and flexible, then learners find that the skills they have acquired are no longer what is needed by the labor market and this frustrates them. If you were to recommend one online course to our Learners, what would it be and why? I think everyone has their own individual motivation and inspiration to learn. So it’s hard to say that any one course would work for everyone. As they say, if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will spend its lifetime thinking it’s stupid and I don’t want to put anybody into that category. What I would do is advise learners to choose something that is cross-cutting, something that you can use not only in your professional life but also something that will contribute to your interpersonal relationships. Also something that is flexible, so that if you change career you can still use the knowledge that you have acquired. I think something like Customer Service Skills falls into that category. Developing Customer Service skills means also developing negotiation skills, marketing skills, and learning how to take care of others as you try and make sure the customer is satisfied and feels valued. These skills are important because they can help you improve your communication skills and even your public speaking. All of these are lifetime skills which you can use anywhere, regardless of your workplace.","length":9852,"tokens":1931,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Alison Anniversary Interviews: Origene Igiraneza","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-anniversary-interviews-origene-igiraneza","essay_date":"Apr 26, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Origene Igiraneza is the CEO of O’Genius Priority, a Rwandan education technology company he founded in 2014 while still in university.

We were without access to the resources that would have helped us excel. That always resonated with me and I wondered how I might change the status quo. Then I went to university and I remember, in my first month, we were studying in the workshops. Now the resources were all there but no one was telling me how they worked. We were studying, theoretically, those things which I should already have been familiar with. I could see I was at a disadvantage and it made me think about how my schooling might have been different. I started thinking about how technology might be used to resolve some of these issues – the scarcity and expense of certain learning materials, the lack of digital learning content, the issue of accessibility.","content_length":939,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Anniversary Interviews: Origene Igiraneza","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-anniversary-interviews-origene-igiraneza","essay_date":"Apr 26, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"When our company began working on the product O’Genius Panda, 78% of secondary schools in Rwanda still didn’t have access to science laboratories. Yet these schools were still teaching science subjects. The students were graduating without getting the chance to enter the lab and were then supposed to pass the national practical examination in science. It just wasn’t fair. Some students walked to better schools just to be able to conduct some experiments but how often can they be expected to do this and how much are they really learning under such conditions? So the motivation was, how do we make quality educational resources accessible to everyone across the nation? How can I use the skills that I have and the technology that I love to impact as many people as possible and for generations to come? What’s your proudest achievement in the education sector? There have been a lot of achievements.

This isn’t something we take for granted. Students who use O’Genius Panda have testified that it helped to increase their academic performance by 10% on average, compared to how they were performing before starting to use the platform. It’s also very inspiring for us to see that the platform has been visited by people from 109 countries across the world. During the pandemic period, the platform became one of the cornerstones for education in Rwanda. We were humbled to work in partnership with the Ministry of Education, the Rwandan Education Board and the Mastercard Foundation to advance accessibility and to make education available to all of the kids who needed it. The schools were closed for over 8 months but, through our platform, students could continue to learn and access materials as if they were still in school.","content_length":904,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Anniversary Interviews: Origene Igiraneza","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-anniversary-interviews-origene-igiraneza","essay_date":"Apr 26, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Though they were in a homeschool set up, they could still learn and have access to teachers to support them and to a community in which they could share. It has really made an impact in terms of making sure that thousands of teenage students, who might otherwise be exposed to drug abuse or other distractions, could focus on learning and access a platform where they could keep up their studies. What has been the most important development you’ve witnessed in education in your professional lifetime? In a country like ours, which is still developing, there are so many things that are currently changing, but the biggest change is the one happening in mindset. You find that many people still don’t understand the role of technology in supporting children’s education, including teachers, parents, school representatives, even some students. You still find teachers who believe that the only way to deliver a class is by using chalk on a blackboard.","content_length":952,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Anniversary Interviews: Origene Igiraneza","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-anniversary-interviews-origene-igiraneza","essay_date":"Apr 26, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"You also find that some parents can’t believe that a kid can learn on a computer or on their phone and get the same quality of education that they could get when sitting in front of a teacher. I’m not undermining the presence of a teacher or of face-to-face learning but there are other alternatives that people can leverage. This shift in mindset in which parents understand that their child can learn from anywhere is really important. It has meant that parents have started supporting their kids by paying for subscriptions for certain educational resources and purchasing devices so they can keep up their studies. It’s been a fascinating shift because before, if you asked a parent to give their kid a phone, they’d only think in terms of social media or things that were going to distract them as opposed to focusing them on learning. But over time, they have accepted that there are alternative learning models that young people can access.","content_length":947,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Anniversary Interviews: Origene Igiraneza","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-anniversary-interviews-origene-igiraneza","essay_date":"Apr 26, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"I really advocate this model because when a young person is given access to technology at an early age, they don’t just use it to learn the skills that they are being taught but they also learn how to use technology effectively. If we look to the future, the skills that will be needed are mostly based on technology. We need to prepare young people so that they will be competent and know how to make technology work for them. Why is free education so important in addressing global inequality? I believe it’s important to support people who are coming from an underprivileged background to get a quality education so they can improve their lives. If you ask a parent in a rural area who is struggling to pay for health insurance for their child to pay tuition or to pay for an online resource, they’re not going to consider that. It’s not going to be one of their priorities.","content_length":877,"content_tokens":184,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Anniversary Interviews: Origene Igiraneza","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-anniversary-interviews-origene-igiraneza","essay_date":"Apr 26, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"There needs to be support for people who are living in poverty-stricken or rural areas who need access to tools and resources to get an opportunity to learn. That’s where development partners need to come in so that these kids can have access to the materials that they need to shape their own lives. Why do you think that digital learning has been such a game changer when it comes to democratising education? Online education is a game-changer when you think of its scalability, portability, accessibility, flexibility, and affordability. These factors highlight the importance of digital learning and online resources versus in-place learning. Learning is longer defined by the four walls of the classroom. It can happen anywhere, as you can now access quality education without necessarily attending a classroom from morning to evening. The flexibility of this alternative is the beauty of technology. In countries like Rwanda, we have few qualified and trained teachers, who are only available in elite schools.","content_length":1016,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Anniversary Interviews: Origene Igiraneza","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-anniversary-interviews-origene-igiraneza","essay_date":"Apr 26, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"How might it be possible that these teachers could reach as many young people as possible, without overwhelming that teacher and without asking the children to move around? This is possible through technology, as one teacher can now reach thousands of children. Technology plays a huge role in making sure there is an equal distribution of resources. What in your opinion is the most pressing educational issue globally? There is an issue with old-fashioned teaching styles and practices. You find that some of the ways people are teaching do not reflect how the current generation is willing to learn. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed by education systems as it hinders the motivation for learners. This goes hand-in-hand with the issue of some teaching materials not being up-to-date. If a curriculum remains static and isn’t updated, then this affects the skills that learners are graduating with.","content_length":918,"content_tokens":176,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Alison Anniversary Interviews: Origene Igiraneza","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-anniversary-interviews-origene-igiraneza","essay_date":"Apr 26, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"If an education system is not dynamic and flexible, then learners find that the skills they have acquired are no longer what is needed by the labor market and this frustrates them. If you were to recommend one online course to our Learners, what would it be and why? I think everyone has their own individual motivation and inspiration to learn. So it’s hard to say that any one course would work for everyone. As they say, if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will spend its lifetime thinking it’s stupid and I don’t want to put anybody into that category. What I would do is advise learners to choose something that is cross-cutting, something that you can use not only in your professional life but also something that will contribute to your interpersonal relationships. Also something that is flexible, so that if you change career you can still use the knowledge that you have acquired. I think something like Customer Service Skills falls into that category. Developing Customer Service skills means also developing negotiation skills, marketing skills, and learning how to take care of others as you try and make sure the customer is satisfied and feels valued. These skills are important because they can help you improve your communication skills and even your public speaking. All of these are lifetime skills which you can use anywhere, regardless of your workplace.","content_length":1395,"content_tokens":272,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"The Ultimate Job Interview Checklist","url":"https://alison.com/blog/ultimate-job-interview-checklist","date":"Apr 26, 2021","thanks":"","content":"A recent poll we conducted among our Learners on how best to prepare for a job interview yielded some surprising results. Our survey revealed that the most popular form of interview preparation was, in fact, researching the interviewer (33%). This was followed by googling interview questions (32%), memorising your CV and achievements (22%) and meditation (13%). What’s so surprising about these results is that the two most popular preparation methods focus on the interviewer and the interview format, as opposed to the most pivotal element of the interview process – the interviewee. That means you! While being interviewed for a job can be daunting, you need to concentrate on the aspects that are under your control, and that includes quite a lot. Rather than focusing on things you can’t control (like the interviewer and their questions), it’s important to place yourself at the heart of your interview preparation. The fact that most respondents didn’t focus their preparations on themselves shows a lack of confidence when it comes to interviews. However, if you’ve made it to the interview stage of the hiring process, then that means the employer sees you as someone who can add value to their company. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have made it this far. You need to remember to bear this in mind and take confidence from it. To help you prepare for your next job interview, we’ve compiled the ultimate interview checklist to make sure you do everything right and give yourself the best shot at securing that new job. Before the Interview When researching the company you’re interviewing for, it’s important to focus on how you see yourself fitting into the organisation. The people interviewing you are going to know more about their company than you ever will, so don’t worry about memorising basic facts about the business. What’s more important is showing the interviewer that you already have ideas in mind about how you can improve the daily operations and running of the company. The same goes for researching the role you’re applying for. Study the job description so that you can find ways to align your experience and qualifications with what the employer is looking for. Make the job description work for you. Compile a list of common questions you might expect to answer during the interview. When you’re writing up your answers, make sure to always emphasise your commitment and desire for the job, and why you’re the perfect fit for the company. Once you’ve prepared your sample answers, make sure to study them inside out. The most important preparation for a job interview is to practice the interview process. By doing mock interviews with family or friends you’ll be able to: Acquaint yourself with the “interview feeling” of being the focus of attention. The more comfortable you can feel “on the spot” the more natural your answers will be. Make sure your voice and body language are confident. Get used to giving the answers you’ve prepared and make them sound unrehearsed. Learn how to think on your feet. Get your mock interviewer to throw you a few curve ball questions to get you thinking! Come up with some intelligent and insightful questions for the interviewer. Include questions about the company that show that you really know what you’re talking about. Also don’t be afraid to inquire about salary. Make sure to print out several hard copies of your CV and bring them to the interview. Decide in advance what you’re going to wear and make sure that you have everything organised the night before. The last thing you want to stress about in the morning is having to iron you clothes! It’s important to take care over your appearance and to look your best for the interview. Know exactly where your interview is taking place (down to the room if you can!). Have your travel arrangements made in advance and arrive early. Give yourself plenty of time as turning up late is not an option. (If your interview is taking place online then make sure that you’re familiar with the software.) During the Interview Maintain eye contact with your interviewers. Be professional and friendly, as you would with any other colleagues. Be confident about your accomplishments when asked about them. A job interview isn’t the time to be overly modest. You want the interviewers to feel like you’re the perfect candidate. Maintain a calm and confident body language. Be at ease in the space and don’t fidget. While you’ll mostly be thinking about what you’re going to say next, make sure to listen to what the interviewers are saying! Don’t just listen out for the next question, take in everything they tell you. If there is more than one interviewer, be sure to address them all at various points. Don’t just stare at the person asking the questions. Last but not least, thank the interviewers before you leave! Final impressions can be just as important as first impressions. After the Interview Once the interview is over, make a note of what you were happy with and what you were unhappy with. Which elements of the interview went well? What did the interviewers respond well to? Regardless of how the interview goes, it’s important to always learn from your experiences so that you can improve on your performance next time.","length":5250,"tokens":1095,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"The Ultimate Job Interview Checklist","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/ultimate-job-interview-checklist","essay_date":"Apr 26, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"A recent poll we conducted among our Learners on how best to prepare for a job interview yielded some surprising results.

In essence, it’s the lifelong process of investing in yourself. It’s about expanding your knowledge and skillsets so you can attain the goals you set yourself, both personally and professionally. Personal development is about engaging proactively with life. Rather than waiting for good things to happen, you get out there and make things happen. Committing to personal development is the first step in achieving both your personal and professional goals. While it might be “personal”, self-development isn’t something you do all on your own. Alison offers a wide range of tools that empower you to develop yourself and achieve your career goals. Here are five of the best. Psychometric Testing – Understanding Yourself Better When it comes to your professional life, understanding yourself better means being self-aware of your values, expertise and capabilities. When deliberating between possible career moves, understanding yourself better will enable you to make decisions that positively impact your life. Knowing what you want from your career and the type of work environment or culture you will thrive in goes a long way in helping you pursue the perfect career path. Taking a psychometric test is one of the simplest and most effective ways of understanding yourself professionally. Nowadays, psychometric testing is a common part of many interviews as employers seek to know if a candidate is likely to excel in a certain role or career. Employers run such tests to assess your intelligence, skills, and personality. The tests can also gauge your capacity to handle stress, your inductive reasoning, situational judgment, and how well you work with others. Alison provides a free workplace personality assessment to help you identify where your strengths and weaknesses lie. These tests have been administered to some of the world’s top corporate enterprises and are backed by rigorous, scientific evaluation. This assessment is a great way to get a better sense of yourself professionally The Career Guide – Navigating An Everchanging Job Landscape The modern job market is constantly changing. The employment landscape as it exists today is vastly different from what it was even a few years ago. The workforce continues to change at a rapid pace and more than half of the jobs that will be available in 2030 do not even exist yet. Consider where we are now. The Covid-19 pandemic was completely unpredicted and resulted in millions of people losing their jobs, while at the same time, plenty of opportunities also emerged. With that in mind, it’s important to be able to constantly adapt when it comes to your career. Alison’s Career Guide allows you to explore hundreds of potential alternative careers. This fantastic tool can be searched by Industry, Career Path or Occupation and offers vital information on the career in question. The Career Guide also links you to relevant courses related to that industry. The Alison Career Guide is the perfect tool for researching different careers and learning which skills you need to succeed Craft the Perfect CV – Presenting Yourself When it comes to the job-seeking process, one of the toughest challenges is writing a good CV. Crafting a professional and eye-catching CV is necessary to make you stand out from the other candidates, and help you secure that all-important interview. The exact format and content of your CV depends on the industry you’re pursuing a career in. However, there are some universal constants to include when writing your CV. These key elements are all covered in this great course detailing the CV and cover letter writing process. It looks at how to design a professional header and layout, concisely outline your experience and the various formats you should use, depending on the career you’re pursuing. Learning Hubs – Gaining Expertise Without expertise knowledge on a particular subject or in a specific field, your career opportunities will be limited to jobs with a low skillset entry point. This confines you to applying for low paid work as the more specialised your job, the higher the salary you tend to earn. In order to get the best out of yourself and maximise your earning potential, it’s important to develop a unique and valuable set of skills, abilities and knowledge. A CV that marks you out as an expert in your chosen field will allow you to apply for more tailored roles that demand higher salaries. To help you master your chosen subject or skill, Alison is launching a series of Learning Hubs. Learning Hubs are spaces where you can immerse yourself in a particular topic and access a range of courses that will both broaden and deepen your understanding of a subject.

The Hubs also include Frequently Asked Questions and links to Alison Blog posts that will expand your knowledge on your chosen topic. Interview Skills – Doing Yourself Justice A job interview is your chance to show your potential employer that you are the right person for the job. It’s your chance to showcase the skills and expertise that you’ve worked hard to develop. If you’ve managed to get to the interview stage, then you have every reason to be confident that you’re fully qualified and deserving of the job in question. It’s crucial that you acknowledge and own that confidence during the interview itself. Don’t be modest about your accomplishments or your CV – show the organisation that they need you Alison offers a series of interview-focused courses that cover all of the relevant topics to help you succeed in doing yourself, and your achievements, justice when it comes to the job interview. These courses includes all of the key soft and interpersonal skills necessary for making a great first impression, and also a lasting one.

Talented engineers have little issue in finding work as they are always in demand across a variety of sectors. One of the most popular and interesting fields they find employment in is Industrial Engineering, or “IE” for short. Industrial Engineering encompasses a wide variety career paths and can offer lots of opportunities for changing lanes. However, getting started in Industrial Engineering can be a steep learning curve, but there are a few steps you can take that will give you a great chance of launching a successful career in this fascinating sector. Start With The Basics Industrial Engineering is just that, engineering applied to industry. It covers a wide range of topics, but put simply, it is concerned with the building and maintenance of industrial machinery. As an industrial engineer, you’ll often find yourself optimising different systems and working in a variety of sectors, however the basic principles are usually the same. Naturally, it’s vitally important that you learn all about these basic principles, as you’ll be needing them regardless of where you end up working. Knowledge of Control Systems A huge part of industrial engineering is the construction and operation of control systems. Examples of these include temperature, liquid level, and gas level control systems, which all play a crucial role in a variety of industries. The central principles of control systems are constant, whether it’s an incubator in a hospital or a water tank in an aquarium, making this a highly transferable skill. For this reason, learning about the operation of control valves in IE is an excellent way to improve your employability in this field. Advanced Ideas and Concepts Once you’re confident that you’ve mastered the basics of industrial engineering, then the next step is to tackle the more advanced concepts. These more demanding skills are ones that employers will be looking out for, so it’s worth your while earning an impressive certification in this area.

Chuck has over ten years experience in the field of adult education and is a passionate advocate for educational accessibility. As part of his brief with BOCES, Chuck is the organizer of the Diversion Program which helps at-risk individuals stay out of the criminal justice system by gaining an education. Chuck has teamed with Alison in the past to pioneer the use of free online courses as a form of alternative sentencing and continues to champion the cause of education instead of incarceration through his work at BOCES. The Alison Blog was delighted to chat to Chuck as part of our 14 Year Celebration interview series. Hi Chuck! What inspired you to choose a career in education? Funny story! I didn’t choose a career in education, it chose me. After receiving a B. S. in Computer Engineering I began a career as an analyst, systems administrator, and project manager in the banking industry. While in between contracts with different banks I received a phone call from my mother who is an adult education program manager. She asked if I’d be willing to teach a computer class for a few weeks while they looked for an instructor to replace someone who had left the organization. I said no. She eventually wore me down (and threatened to never cook for me again) and I agreed to teach for a few weeks. That was almost 13 years ago. I think what struck me initially was the humanity involved. I was used to dealing with data, networks, and engineers. There wasn’t much emotion in my previous roles. Coming into education, especially adult education, was a bit of a culture shock. Helping people with situations I could hardly imagine were real, having them find success, and then come back to thank me for my help was something I hadn’t really experienced to that point. I suppose I found a passion for helping people and my “few week” stint as a computer teacher has turned into a life-long mission. What has been your proudest achievement in the education sector? This is a tough question to answer. I’ve been involved in some interesting projects over the years. From the bigger picture perspective, I would say working with the New York State Department of Education to lower the age of eligibility for one of our online High School Equivalency pathways, thus making the program more accessible for students who are profoundly struggling with traditional school. That being said, I have so many stories of people I’ve had the honor of working with that have overcome impossible odds in life. My ability to play a small part in helping them achieve their goals is a truly overwhelming experience. What has been the most important development you’ve witnessed in education in your professional lifetime? Not to hit the nail on the head but technology, the internet, and the accessibility those things allow for. In many ways the methods with which we deliver education haven’t changed in centuries. Put students in a room with a teacher. Have that teacher explain a concept. Repeat. With increased accessibility to online resources, along with new smartboard technology, teachers have a never ending catalog of resources to help them make lessons more interesting, relatable, and engaging for students. In an age where attention spans seem to be getting shorter by the day, teachers are having to find more ways to keep student engagement up, and the tools given to them by technology are the solution. Why is free education so important in addressing global inequality? The ability to access quality education shouldn’t be limited by your financial situation. But if you live in a region without a reliable public education system you are left in a seemingly impossible situation if you are hoping to grow beyond the confines of your community. If we as a society have the resources to extend access to education to those that don’t currently have that advantage, I believe it is our responsibility to help close the gap. Why do you think that online learning has been such a game changer when it comes to democratising education? I think it comes down to cost. Once upon a time the only way to learn was to go to where the books and teachers were and those institutions cost a lot of money to maintain and attend, particularly if a person had to travel a great distance to do so. With ever increasing internet access, the need for brick and mortar establishments is constantly shrinking. A child in even the most remote region that has a cell phone can access all the same materials as a student at a prestigious university. While accreditation remains a hurdle, the availability of the information itself is becoming greater every day. What in your opinion is the most pressing educational issue globally? I’m afraid I’m going back to the well too many times but it’s all about accessibility. Even where I am in Western New York State, there are so many people that due to their circumstances can’t reasonably access education. Whether it is lack of transportation, lack of adequate child care, or a work schedule that doesn’t allow someone to engage with educational programming, the result is the same. There are people that want to take ownership of their future through education but simply can’t. The growth of online learning tools and resources has helped us immeasurably in our ability to bring education to the student rather than forcing the student to come to us. If you were to recommend one online course to our Learners, what would it be and why? It would be hard to narrow it down to one. But it would definitely be in the world of communication and Alison has so many fantastic courses in communication. Perhaps the Introduction to Communication Skills. Far too often, problems that arise, whether it be in school, at work, or at home, boil down to poor communication. The ability to clearly convey information seems to be a skill that many people struggle with. Strong communication skills are the foundation of success in any endeavor. What advice would you give to Alison’s Learners who are using free online learning to empower themselves? I’ll simply quote Coach Jimmy Valvano. “Don’t give up. Don’t ever give up.” Education is the key to all the locks. Never stop learning. Never stop growing. Never stop chasing your dreams.","length":6392,"tokens":1298,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Alison Anniversary Interviews: Chuck Diemert","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-anniversary-interviews-chuck-diemert","essay_date":"Apr 22, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Chuck Diemert is the Literacy Zone Coordinator with the Orleans/Niagara Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) in New York.

Literature For those with an interest in the literary use of language, English offers a particularly rich tradition of world famous poets, novelists and dramatists. From the works of famed playwrights such as William Shakespeare to those of revered novelists such as Charles Dickens, English literature is one of the greatest treasure troves in any language!","content_length":753,"content_tokens":146,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"The Business of Mental Health","url":"https://alison.com/blog/business-mental-health","date":"Apr 21, 2021","thanks":"","content":"A successful leader in business will always have a lot on their plate.

So to help our entrepreneurial Learners improve their workplaces, we’ve put together a list of the top things you need to be aware of as a leader when it comes to improving and cultivating strong mental health among your employees. 1. Recognize the Signs Mental health problems can be difficult to spot, but you can train yourself to recognize some telltale signs. Sometimes these can be as simple as an employee having more trouble with their work than usual, but they are often more nuanced. By learning how to spot these signs, you’ll be better positioned to help your employees and maintain team cohesion. 2. Be Open and Raise Awareness Everyone can hit a rough patch and your employees are no different. An employee should feel that they are able to report any issues they have to you without fearing that their problems will be disregarded. By raising awareness of mental health issues in the workplace, you can encourage employees to report any issues they’re having to you, allowing you to help them solve their problems and keep the team moving. 3.

As a leader, it is crucial that you are flexible enough to help employees in a way that suits the situation.

Unfortunately, it’s quite poorly understood. There are a lot of misconceptions around the topic, and it’s easy to get swept away by it all. To make things easier and clearer, we’ve put together four simple steps you can take to improve your mental health. 1. Learn the Facts Mental health is a tricky topic at the best of times, so it’s important to stay informed and up to date. Poor mental health is an illness and, like any illness, you can spot the signs if you know what to look for. By keeping up to date with mental health studies, you’ll be able to identify mental health issues in yourself and others. 2. Raise Awareness A problem cannot be solved if no one knows it exists. People can be reluctant to discuss mental health issues and so they often go untreated. One of the best ways to make yourself and others feel more comfortable about discussing your mental health is to get involved in raising awareness. 3. Acknowledge and Treat It Seemingly small issues can become mental health problems surprisingly easily. An increasingly stressful work issue here, some missed sleep there, it can be very easy to dismiss such things as small, contained problems. However if small issues like these stay unresolved and start to pile up, then they can cause bigger problems down the line. You can avoid this mistake by familiarising yourself with the everyday stressors you need to keep an eye on. 4. Always Keep Improving If you feel like your mental health is in order, it can be very easy to just forget about it. However, you can always keep improving and you should, because your mental health is the lens through which you view the world. Improving on your mental health is a great way to improve your quality of life, and is an excellent avenue for self-improvement.","length":1840,"tokens":389,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"4 Simple Steps to Improve Your Mental Health","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/4-simple-steps-improve-mental-health","essay_date":"Apr 21, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Mental health is a vitally important aspect of all of our lives.

But one by one, you keep getting turned down for the job. It sounds like something’s going wrong during your interviews. To give you a helping hand, here’s our top 5 biggest interview mistakes candidates make. You dressed inappropriately Thought you might get away without ironing that shirt? Think again. Dressing down or dressing shabbily is a surefire way to get turned down for a job. The same goes for too much makeup or perfume for women. First impressions last, so always dress smartly and take extra time with your appearance. Your nerves let you down Just like looking presentable makes a good first impression, so does confidence. We’re not talking arrogance here, just an inner confidence that inspires others to have confidence in you too. There will inevitably be some nerves, but even if you’re not feeling very confident, act as if you are. The employer needs to know that you’re capable and will be able to handle pressure. Just remember the saying, ‘Fake it ‘til you make it’. You forgot your manners An interview is a two-way interaction. Try not to talk over the interviewer, or talk consistently. Remembering that while in a formal setting, this is still a social interaction. It requires that delicate dance of listening and talking like all successful conversations. Non-verbal communication such as nodding, showing understanding and eye contact is also important. Remember also that your body language speaks volumes, so try to avoid slouching and folding your arms. You know nothing about the job on offer or the company Having prepared adequately for the interview is key. There’s possibly nothing worse for an interviewer than discovering the interviewee knows nothing about the company or the position. It shows a lack of initiative, not to mention interest. Finding out as much as possible about the company, the people who are interviewing you and the post on offer will have you feeling more confident. The knowledge you portray will have the interviewer feeling more confident in your abilities and suitability for the post too. You bad mouthed your previous employer So your previous employer was a nightmare to work for, but your interviewer doesn’t need to know that. While you feel that they might sympathise with your plight, discussing your previous employer’s downfalls will only make you look bad.

To join the elite group of successful entrepreneurs takes much more. Think of the late Steve Jobs, Walt Disney, Oprah Winfrey or even Alison’s own Founder and CEO, Mike Feerick – what is it about these individuals that makes them such highly successful entrepreneurs? The pages of business biographies and ‘How To’ manuals are littered with the tales of these successful people, but is it possible to identify the traits that have made them a success? Even more importantly, can anyone emulate those traits in order to become a successful entrepreneur? The Alison community team have looked at the research, had a quick chat with our Founder and CEO, Mike, and have put together the ultimate list. Here are 7 traits of highly successful entrepreneurs. Passion This is the number one trait that all successful entrepreneurs share. They are always deeply passionate about what they do. It is this passion that sustains them during the inevitable tough times of running your own business. Vision Successful entrepreneurs have a clear vision and are committed to making that vision a reality. They are also able to charismatically communicate that vision to their staff so that the entire team is focused on making that vision a living reality. Risk Taker In order to be a successful entrepreneur, you must be willing to take risks and live with uncertainty. There is nothing certain about running your own business, so you need to be sure you can live with that. Motivation Successful entrepreneurs are both motivated and motivator. They are willing to put in long hours at work to make their entrepreneurial dream a reality. But they are also able to motivate others to get the best out of their team. Salesperson You don’t see this on too many entrepreneurial lists, but we are adamant that this is a trait all entrepreneurs have in spades. A successful entrepreneur is a born seller. They sell their idea, often when it’s still an abstract thought. They can sell their vision, persuasively and successfully, ensuring the buy-in of staff, customers and investors alike. Determination All successful entrepreneurs have one golden motto they live by: “Never give up”. No matter how bumpy the road gets and no matter how often they may fail, they always find a way forward. It is this tenacity that makes them stand out from the crowd. Rule breaker Successful entrepreneurs never follow the crowd. They are leaders and visionaries, and as such, are rule breakers. They are constantly asking the question, ‘Why not’? and finding the answer is always, ‘I can’. With a pinch of passion, loads of dedication and a flair for innovation – your entrepreneur dream can become a reality.

Here are Alison’s top 5 tips to make you more productive with your day. Step away from the email Being on call via email throughout your workday can derail even the most diligent of workers. Set aside specific times to check your mail, say first thing in the morning and just before you leave work. That way, you stay connected, but you’re not distracted from your work on an ongoing basis throughout the day, letting you be more productive. Look after yourself Pushing yourself to the max might help you achieve today, but if this becomes a pattern, burnout could be just around the corner. Possibly the most important part of being productive is to be in good shape – physically and mentally. So get enough good quality sleep, eat well and exercise. You’ll be refreshed, refueled and de-stressed. Breathe Whether it’s through ten minutes of meditation in the morning and evening, or simply reminding yourself to breathe deeply throughout the day, getting some oxygen into your brain will keep you more alert, centered, and working more productively. Plan Your Tasks around your Energy Levels In order to be more productive, you need to use your energy levels to your advantage. If you have the most energy in the morning, get your most pressing and most demanding tasks done first. Leave the less taxing work for when your energy wanes in the late afternoon. If your energy does start to slump, go for a walk, get a glass of water, or have a healthy snack. You’ll feel more refreshed and ready to take on the next task with gusto. Take note Keep notes of all your to-dos as a means of brain dumping, clearing your mind so you can focus on the task at hand. Writing a to-do list for the next day just before you leave work is another great way to be more productive and brain dump. For those who take their work home with them? Keep a notebook beside your bed and write down everything that’s on your mind, work-related and personal. You’ll be in a better position to take on the world in a more productive way the next day.","length":2115,"tokens":461,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"5 Easy Ways You Can Be More Productive","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/5-ways-productive","essay_date":"Apr 17, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"In a world where time is king, being more productive with your day is the key to success.

In the majority of cases, it’s preparation. Most people will be at least slightly, if not very, nervous, before speaking publicly. The trick is to channel those nerves into something positive, rather than seeing it as a failure before you even begin. Here are Alison’s top five tips for giving a killer presentation: Get Clarity Sitting down and thinking about what it is you want to get across is the very first thing you need to do. What is the presentation about? What are the main points you need to get across? Create Your Story Think of your presentation as a story – you have a story to tell and you want to tell it in the most effective way possible. By having a beginning, middle and an end, your presentation would be just like any other story. Make sure that it’s clear, concise, sticks to the point, and doesn’t try to fit in too many points. Think of crafting a story – you want it to flow, to be entertaining, to engage – all the things that make a great story. Telling a story that the whole audience can relate to is a great way to start a presentation. It piques attention and creates interest from the get go. The same goes for the end; tell an interesting story to close and you’ll be onto a winner. Practice Practice is one of the most important things you can do. Reading from a slide or directly from notes is a no-no – you need to be comfortable enough with the content so that you can focus on connecting with your audience, as opposed to trying to remember the information – this means practice, practice, practice. If you need prompts, a few bullet points on a card that you can glance at every now and then should get you through. Connect with your audience Eye contact is another clincher. You’re attempting to connect with your audience, so look at them. If you’re too busy looking at notes or staring at your feet through nervousness, you’ll lose the connection straight away. Equally, projecting your voice so that it comes across as commanding and engaging, without being aggressive, will hold the audience’s attention. If you’re using a PowerPoint Presentation, using a maximum of ten slides is recommended. Try not to focus your whole presentation around the slides. They should be used as a guide, not a focus. Fake it till You Make It Staying confident is essential. While you might be quivering with nervousness, remaining calm and in control is key. Believe you’re going to give a great presentation. Nerves are a normal part of speaking in front of people; try channeling your nerves into giving a great presentation, into having a more powerful voice and into putting more passion into your presentation.

From the streets, you walk every day, to the vast open rural landscapes, or even the food on your plate! Photography lets you see the world in a whole new light, appreciate the details and the beauty in your surroundings. Explore the world through the lens! 2. Meet new people Be it meeting local residents when you travel to a new place, or run-into fellow like-minded people as you travel, you are bound to make new friends when you are a photographer. Photography lets you get to know people in different ways through the lenses and also lets you learn from people and see the world through their perspective. 3. Capture a moment There are hundreds of famous moments in history captured in a second but tells us a whole story. Photography gives you that opportunity to say a thousand different things and tell a story with one image. 4. Challenge yourself The beauty of photography is that there’s always something new. If it’s new equipment, you need to learn how to use it. If you need to go to a new location for a photo shoot, that might put you out of your comfort zone. There are always challenges in photography, pushing you to achieve your best. You’ll learn new things not only about photography but about yourself as you explore your more creative side! 5. Live in the present The fast-paced, technology-driven world we live in can sometimes mean we miss out on the present and those everyday moments. Photography will encourage you to live in the moment and appreciate life’s little beauties as you pay attention to the detail in the everyday. 6. Share your perspective Photography is an amazing creative outlet that lets you express yourself in a million different ways. It allows you to share your passion and views with the world. With so many platforms available today you can share your pictures instantaneously. Who knows you might be able to photograph your favourite band one day! 7. A great mental outlet While photography is an amazing outlet to share your passion with the world, it can also be a great mental outlet. In a hectic and pressurised world, photography helps you to relax and enjoy. By immersing yourself in photography, you can forget about the daily stresses and strains. 8. Explore new places Whether it’s a whole new country and culture, or just a different part of town you’ve never been to before, photography opens your eyes to the differences in the world around you. The beauty of a camera (well most of them) is that they are small and compact that you can easily pick them up and take them with you wherever you go. The best way to learn photography is through practice, being able to take one with you wherever you go is always helpful. 9. The camera itself! There so many different types of cameras and camera gears that there’s always something new and exciting to learn and explore. With different lenses, dials and shutters to try and test out, learning about the cameras are really fun. Not to mention the endlessly creative ways you can edit your photo, photography will always have something new, exciting and different to try. Lastly and most importantly …. 10. Enjoy and relive those captured moments Photography gives you the ability to have and relive amazing moments in your life. Whether it was a beautiful sunset or your child’s first steps, you’ll have these moments captured to always look back on and cherish. That’s the beauty of photography – the ability to capture a moment in time to have a remember forever.

As humans, we all seek connection. The more positive the connection, the happier we are. The more content we are, the nicer the environment. If you’re spending over 40 hours of your precious life at work every week, then it’s essential that you’re doing all you can to foster great, healthy work relationships. Here’s how: Be a Good Communicator When conducting business, being open, honest and clear is the best policy, so everyone knows where they stand. People, by nature, generally don’t like uncertainty. Keeping everyone in the loop and encouraging an environment based on open communication is key. Be Likeable Being friendly and inclusive is the very basis of good work relationships. This could be as simple as a friendly ‘Hi’ as you greet a co-worker in the hall. Remember, people like to do business with people they like. If you’re looking to climb the career ladder, your boss will be more likely to want to see you do well if she/he likes you. Create a Positive Work Culture When a colleague does well, praise them (genuinely and without being patronising). Finding solutions to problems as opposed to finding problems in solutions will show you have a can-do attitude. It also creates a more positive work space. Learn how to Give and Take Feedback Learning how to give and take feedback constructively without either offending or taking offence is a very valuable skill. Did you have a manager in the past who was particularly good at giving constructive criticism? Adopt some of this diplomacy in your day-to-day dealings. Have Empathy for Great Relationships You might be in a fast-paced and intense working environment, where people are stressed and tensions run high. Working on relationships, while slightly more challenging in this environment, is even more important. Just remember that each person you work with is dealing with their own very human issues.

It’s never too late to shake things up and change the direction your life is going in. Here are our top 5 tips to getting the life you really want. 1. Change Your Thinking – Change Your Life It’s easy to see life’s challenges as problems. But life is one big challenge, and so if we view every challenge in that way, life becomes, well, one big problem. Successful and positive people see problems as challenges waiting to be solved. Switching your brain from the ‘can’t do’ attitude to the ‘can do’ immediately energises you, makes you more productive and ultimately, happier. Identify what areas are lacking and come up with a plan to bring your life into balance. 2. Do a Life audit Take an honest, reflective look at your life. Do you like what you see? What areas are you happy with? What could do with some work? In life, we have many areas that need to be in balance for us to be happy. There’s work life, family life, personal and social life, spiritual life, finances, among many more. By identifying what areas are lacking in your own life, you can come up with a plan to bring your life into balance. For instance, if your home life is great and your social life is super, but you feel you’re stuck in your career, make a promise to yourself (and a plan) to improve that area of your life. 3. Rethink your Free Time If free time to you means lounging around on the couch watching TV, you might want to rethink how you spend the couple of free hours you have at home every evening. Everyone needs some downtime to unwind and relax, especially after a long day. If you can reduce that downtime to a half-hour, or one, you could be spending time on doing something that’s going to benefit you and your life. Imagine instead if you spent one or two of those hours learning about something you’re interested in or discovering new interests. It could open up a whole new and exciting world of learning, or even a new career! Your outlook will become more positive and your energy levels will soar. 4. Get Fit to Jumpstart Your Life Exercise. We know, you’ve heard it before, but this is one of the best things you could do for your life and your future. Exercising works on so many levels and creates a domino effect in other areas of your life. Not only will you feel better physically, your outlook will become more positive and your energy levels will soar. This will give you the enthusiasm to make the changes you need to make to get the life you want. 5. Push Yourself Every Day Seek out challenges each and every day. Join that photography class you’ve been thinking about for ages, learn a new language, speak more in public. The more you throw yourself into life, the more life will throw great things your way.

That’s why the hiring process can be so tricky. Do it right – you’re on a roll. Do it wrong – you can be left with a whole world of issues to deal with. People being people, it’s often difficult to judge how that person is going to perform in your business. So how can you ensure that you’re doing all you can to hire the right people? Hiring another you As humans, we tend to gravitate towards people like ourselves. So, if you’re hiring only people that are similar to you, knowingly or unknowingly, you’re heading for a fall. Every company needs a variety of skills, and a whole host of personality types to keep the organisation in balance. Hire for Personality No matter how great an interviewee’s CV may look, no matter how articulate they are, or how well they present themselves, if they lack interpersonal skills, there’s little chance they’ll fit in with your company. The best employees are the ones who are positive, upbeat and with a can-do attitude. This helps not only to get the job done in a more efficient and pleasant manner, but also for the morale of the entire team. Skills, people can learn. Personality? There’s no changing that. The Best Fit for Your Company Find people whose values are in line with that of the company. When people have a common goal, and have the same vision for the company, all the energy flows in the same direction. Listening Oftentimes, interviewers spend their time talking, losing a valuable chance to get to know the interviewee. It’s amazing what you can learn if you really listen to what the interviewee is saying. Soft Skills Soft skills such as social and emotional intelligence are often overlooked in an interview. But those with high social intelligence will know what to do when there’s a problem within the office, say with another employee, or when there’s a problem with a client. Creating a great team isn’t just about getting all the right skills together, it’s about creating the right dynamic so that employees are motivated, happy in their jobs and satisfied. Staff Retention Once you have recruited the right person, you then need to ensure you can retain and motivate them so the new employee will commit to your organisation for the long-term. Building a company culture where staff feel valued and appreciated is essential. By promoting a business culture that employees can buy into, they will become more motivated and work more passionately to make the business a success. Creating meaning for employees and giving them the opportunity for continuous learning and upskilling, will ensure your staff stay for the long run.

It’s not failing that will keep you from success, it’s the fear of failing that will keep you from success. In fact, the majority of successful people have failed probably numerous times before. It’s estimated that the majority of first time entrepreneurs will fail, and that it usually takes three attempts before a business will succeed. Why? Because failure is a learning curve. Failure teaches us lessons, shows us where we’ve gone wrong. The fact that failure is seen as something negative in our society, and not the opportunity it is, means that people fear it. It’s not failing, but the fear of failing that will keep you from success. Aim for Success So how can you become resilient to failure? Firstly, think positively. Every little failure is an opportunity to learn. Seek out the lessons in every failure – big and small – make a pact with yourself to learn from your mistakes. Look at failure as your friend, and aim for success. If failure happens to come your way, let it teach you its lessons, and bounce back bigger and stronger than ever. Stay focused. Keep your sights on your end goal. Don’t let yourself get sidetracked by unwarranted advice or the attitudes of people who don’t understand the true strength of failure. Growing Through Failure Remember that failure can make you a better person. It makes you more resilient, it makes you more creative, it forces you to find better ways to do things. It keeps your brain active, as you search for other answers and it keeps you motivated to do even better next time. It’s not the scale, the size, or even the fact of failure that counts. It’s finding and keeping the courage to get back out there again.","length":2168,"tokens":481,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"The Secret to Turning Failure into Success","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/secret-to-turning-failure-into-success","essay_date":"Apr 10, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"If you’ve ever failed, you’ll know that it can sting.

With so many people trying to get employers’ attention, this can seem really difficult. Whenever a new job is posted online, hundreds (sometimes thousands) of people might apply for it at the same time. There is so much noise out there, and you have to make yourself the loudest, best sounding one. How can you do this? You can use social media to your advantage! One of the best ways to stand above that crowd is to have an amazing online profile on social media all the time. That way, employers can see your profile before they even advertise the job. Additionally, if they do advertise the job and you apply with your CV, then they can go to your social media profiles to get even more information about you. That really helps you get fully noticed, and create a great first impression. So, here are four simple steps on how you can use social media to start getting noticed online! 1. Put your info in the top three social media accounts Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. LinkedIn is particularly important, as it’s one of the leading career development platforms in the world. If you can get your basic info onto all three of these sites, then you have made a really good start. On Facebook, fill in the About Me section, on Twitter fill in the Bio, and on LinkedIn, start your profile. Make sure you add these social accounts to your résumé, so your employer knows where to find you online. 2. Fully complete your LinkedIn profile Now that you’re on LinkedIn, fill it out completely. This makes searching for jobs so much easier. It’s especially important to get all of your education and qualifications onto LinkedIn, particularly your online education as this really shows that you’ve gone the extra mile. It’s also a good opportunity to showcase all the hard work you’ve put in on Alison. So don’t forget to add Alison under the Education section. There is also a Certification section on LinkedIn where you can showcase your Alison certificate (if you’ve completed a course). 3. Showcase your work samples So now you have a full online profile. That’s excellent. To make it even better, you have to keep updating it. Regularly post examples of your work to your different accounts. On LinkedIn, fill out Publications, Awards, Research, and even Skills over time. If you’re a photographer or a graphic designer, you can use photo-based platforms like Instagram or Pinterest to exhibit your work as you create it. Every post boosts your profile! 4. Participate in as many discussions as you can! Now that you have a regularly updated online profile, start talking to people. Get involved in industry-specific conversations on Twitter, and start participating in group conversations on LinkedIn. Make sure you follow subject matter-experts, it’s a great way to progress your career. Learn from them and talk to them when you can. Sooner or later, someone you are talking to is going to check out your amazing bio. The next time that person needs to hire someone, they’ll think of you before they even advertise the job. So what are you waiting for?

For those in war zones, there is political unrest, corruption, a lack of services and poor educational facilities. For those struck by natural disasters, there is poverty, a lack of services, among others. However, learning online is providing a lifeline for some, who are determined to educate themselves against the odds. Read how four Alison learners in Sudan, Liberia and Iraq and Haiti are overcoming the barriers to education they face by learning online. As a result of war, life has become terrible… there is a constant economic threat, there is widespread insecurity, there are a lack of jobs and a lack of a sufficiently strong educational institutions in the country. Alison – a Stepping Stone to a Better Life outside Liberia Liberian Tamba Freeman lives in the south eastern part of Liberia called Greenville, Sinoe County. Tamba currently works for the United Nation’s Mission in Liberia as an administrative assistant. A trained administrator and logistician, Tamba has over 20 years’ experience working for Catholic Relief Service (CRS/Liberia) and the Medical Emergency Relief International (MERLIN/Liberia). While the country is in turmoil, Tamba dreams of a better future for him and his family, and so has been learning on Alison to upgrade his education and his chances of gaining employment in another country. Working in the south eastern part of Liberia is challenging, says Tamba. “Prices are very high and the educational system is far below standard due to lack of qualified instructors. There is no college education for students out of high school. College education can mainly be found in the capital, leaving the other counties behind in terms of college education. Due to the lack of standards, high school and college students are not properly prepared for future career development and employment.” High Inflation and High Unemployment in Liberia In addition to the educational and cost issues, services are below standard, with few internet cafes and a very slow network, making communication difficult. Corruption is also a constant problem, he says. “We are faced with bad road conditions, poor internet connectivity, both within the city centers and the rest of country. Unemployment remains high, inflation remains high. The security sector reforms also remain a challenge for the current government. Taxation is also very high and the revenue generated is misused and misappropriated by public institutions and individuals, thus affecting the development process on a large scale.” Corruption in Liberia “Due to the lack of job opportunity, inflation and corruption, only a few people are enjoying the country – mainly Government officials and a few others who are working with and holding senior positions with the UN and other international organisations. The dependence ratio has increased, with very few people within the working class able to afford to educate their children in foreign schools.” Tamba says that, all in all, the majority of people are “very disappointed” in the current government due to the lack of job opportunity, inflation and corruption, and are all “praying for a change in leadership”. “Until we can have a change in leadership and a change of attitude and minds, a good future still seems to be far away for my country.” He says that nepotism also remains a challenging force in the country, resulting in one group having a much better quality of life than the majority of Liberians. “For better change, it takes the will of the people to determine a definite course of action through a peaceful political determination leading to better selection of public figures with credible image both from abroad and back home. This will make Liberia a better place to live and invest in, considering the wealth of natural resources available for a country with a population of three million inhabitants.” Lack of Quality Education in Liberia Despite the challenges Tamba and his country face, he is currently working hard to obtain an international position within the United Nations outside of Liberia. “This would afford me the opportunity of achieving my dreams as an international civil servant, affording my children better quality college education outside of Liberia. Quality college education in my country still remains challenging, thus rendering our standards far below other African countries.” Currently working on four diploma courses with Alison, Tamba says learning online with the free education platform has improved his prospects of realising his dream. “Alison has improved my professional experience and prospects of obtaining a better and higher position in the areas of administration and logistics for future employment. I am currently working on my last four diploma courses with Alison.” Incomes have increased from around US$10 per month to approximately US $400 a month and Iraqis can now can buy furniture, cars, build houses and travel, but there are still many challenges. Corruption in Iraq – the Challenges Ali Al-Sarraf, who lives in Southern Iraq, works as an administrative employee in an international foundation. He has been studying on Alison for some time, improving his human resources skills and learning English. He believes it has benefited his career greatly and given him more opportunities in a country where there are still many challenges. Ali, who is 33, and married with three children, says that, while things are stable for him and his family, it’s a different story for many others in the country. Life is better in Iraq now than before 2003, he says, but more improvements are needed, particularly with regards to security and services. “Incomes have increased from around US$10 per month to approximately US $400 a month and Iraqis can now can buy furniture, cars, build houses and travel, but there are still many challenges. Corruption is considered to be the number one problem because other countries and organisations gave a lot of money to Iraq for its reconstruction, but corruption has led to the failure of this being done. With regards to my city, the security situation is OK, but in other cities in Western Iraq there are bombs, terrorism and kidnappings. Services are poor throughout the country, especially with regards to electricity, drinking water, roads and the health system. Frustration with Government in Iraq The challenges faced by the country change from region to region, with some areas faring much better than others, he says. “For example, in North Iraq (Kurdish area), employment is good because of good security and more stability. Also in southern Iraq (Basra), there are many oil companies, so there are many jobs. But in other cities, like middle Iraq, there are few jobs.” Ali says that many people are frustrated and unsatisfied with government performance and are looking forward to a better future. From Ali’s perspective, he would like to see peace reigning and an end to the corruption that has plagued the country. Alison, he says, has improved his skills, particularly in relation to HR, company administration and English. Studying on Alison has also made him behave more professionally with his co-workers, he feels. Education Crisis In Haiti While not a war zone, Haiti has faced its own challenges in recent years – political unrest, social unrest and natural disasters. These have posed a number of barriers to education. Samuel Albert, who lives in the Dominican Republic, grew up in Haiti, and remembers a wonderful, carefree and happy childhood. While he has been forced to leave formal education due to financial pressures, he has been using ALISON to fill the gaps in his education. “It was fun when I was younger. I enjoyed my childhood – going to school every morning with a group of fellow students, having fun all the way to school. At school, there was an atmosphere of respect. Teachers were very concerned about our education, our parents were very happy for us to go to school, always wanting to make sure that we got to the next grade every year.” However, when political and social unrest began to take hold in Haiti, things changed for Samuel and his fellow countrymen and women. “After I graduated from high school, the problems started. There was no more childhood, the country was no longer in peace and there were political problems all the time. Young university students were dying all the time.” Fierce Competition for University Places in the Dominican Republic While Samuel was determined to continue with his studies, competition for college places is fierce, with many colleges holding competitions where only the highest achieving students secure a place at college, leaving the majority of would-be students left behind. “So I had to make another choice, which was go to a professional institute. My dad suggested that I go to one of the best professional institutes in the country. He was ready to pay for the two-year electronic engineering course, but it was the same thing here – a competition to get in. I actually won the seventh place in the competition, but, because I was a couple of hours late to pay the fee, unfortunately I lost my place.” And so, following this disappointment, Samuel moved to the Dominican Republic to continue with his studies. Unfortunately, the cost of continuing to keep Samuel at university was too much for his father to bear and so Samuel was forced to give up his university place and find a job. “I have been living in the Dominican Republic since, working to take care of myself and hoping to go back to the university to continue my career. Since I left, I have been taking courses on Alison and wish to make the most of them that I can. Things in the Dominican Republic were good when I started to work first, but as time has gone on, we now don’t have the same peace as Haiti. They have literally asked us to leave, so now I am now living in an unpeaceful atmosphere, and will be forced to leave the country as soon as possible.” *Names have been changed to protect the identity of the Alison learners in this article.","length":10169,"tokens":2016,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"How Online Study is Breaking Down Barriers To Education in Sudan, Liberia and Iraq","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/how-online-study-is-breaking-down-barriers-to-education-in-sudan-liberia-and-iraq","essay_date":"Apr 7, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Learning in a war zone – People in countries all over the world face barriers to education for different reasons.

It shouldn’t. It turns out learning basic code is actually quite easy. While a basic course won’t make you a pro, it will give you control of a whole lot of things. Who knows – maybe even a new career! Here are five simple ways that HTML can boost your career: Update Your Own Website So you pay someone a lot of money to design you this great looking new website. But then updates need to be done, mostly minor, but you can’t do them yourself. More than being just a little frustrating, having so little control over something that could be very simple is pretty wasteful. Learning basic HTML will allow you to make those simple changes on your website if and when you need to. HTML – A Super Marketing Tool With your newly acquired coding skills, you can enhance your marketing capabilities, through creating great eye-catching emails and newsletters. This means that the company you work for, or your own company, get the benefit of revved up marketing campaigns with just a little upskilling. Career Opportunities Just about every company is looking for multi-skilled people these days. It’s no longer good enough to be just a writer, or just a designer. If you check out the jobs section of any major recruitment agency, the jobs on offer seek multi-skilled workers – such as a great designer with coding skills, who’s also a super communicator. You’ve seen the briefs! Make yourself more valuable and employable by adding HTML to your list of skills.

But then updates need to be done, mostly minor, but you can’t do them yourself.

Learning basic HTML will allow you to make those simple changes on your website if and when you need to.

The secret to successful Project Management is that you’re going to have to put in the groundwork. Being a super successful project manager isn’t just down to talent. Here’s our top 9 tips for a smooth, successful project. 1. Plan your project Putting time, effort and thought into the planning of the project is the first and most critical step. While it might be tempting to plough ahead when enthusiasm is at its peak, you need to invest the time into setting realistic timelines, goals and definitive deadlines for your project. As the old saying goes, ‘If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.’ 2. It’s all about the people Having the right team in place to implement the project is another necessity when planning. Having the right people with the right skills to pull off the project as smoothly as possible is your aim. 3. Get everyone in on the loop Having an in-depth discussion regarding responsibilities, expectations and deadlines is the next step. Have everyone’s roles laid out clearly and plainly, making sure everyone understands what’s expected of them. 4. Project management tools and tricks Having an online management tool in place can be invaluable, allowing a clean, no-nonsense and organised approach to managing your project. Research and decide on a project management tool that suits you and the needs of your project. 5. Do the most important work first If you can get the biggest or most complex jobs done first, you’re off to an ideal start. That way, should issues arise, you will have time to iron them out. 6. Stay on top of the tasks Regular updates are necessary to ensure everything is going smoothly on the project. If any problems arise, you can address them quickly before they become major problems and stall the project. Have brief update meetings regularly, on a daily or weekly basis, depending on how your project is progressing. 7. Successful project managers stay motivated Stay motivated and ensure your team do too. Give them regular updates, keep them in the loop and provide constructive feedback on how their work is going. A good project manager stays on top of their team’s progress. A great project manager does this and gives them the autonomy to get creative, leading to a more effective and enthusiastic team. 8. Be flexible Things don’t always go to plan, there will be hiccups and issues along the way. It’s the way you deal with those roadblocks that make all the difference. Being ready and alert to change will ensure everything runs smoothly. 9. Keep your eye on the prize While getting stuck in and doing the legwork is an essential part of project management, keeping your eye on the end result, without getting bogged down with detail, is the key to keeping things moving.","length":2885,"tokens":606,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"9 Key Steps to Smart Project Management","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/9-key-steps-to-smart-project-management","essay_date":"Apr 6, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"There’s a world of difference between projects that are taken on and carried out willy-nilly, and those that are planned with precision and finesse.

However, while many people want to speak a new language, traditional teaching methods put people off and the majority give up early on as the process becomes long, boring and arduous. It doesn’t have to be that way! Traditional teaching methods can exhaust your patience, especially when it comes to learning languages. As free online learning pioneers, the team at Alison is continually coming up with new ways to make learning fun and easy.

In order to help you master your chosen second language, we have also come up with 6 simple tips that will have you speaking your new language with confidence in the shortest possible time! 1. Carry a dictionary If you are serious about learning a second language, you need to encounter it every day. Try to think in your new language. Carry a dictionary with you and look up the words to describe various items or events you come across. 2. Talk the talk When we start learning a new language, we often get hung up on proper pronunciation or learning the alphabet. Focus on trying to build your basic conversation skills. Try conversing in the language out loud, even if you have no one else to talk to but yourself! 3. Master the basics Start with the basics first – How to say Hello, Goodbye, How are you? Your focus should be on building your conversation skills, so try to learn as many useful everyday phrases as possible. 4. Stick to it Visualising the words and phrases can be very useful. Write them down on Post-its and stick them around the house. These will serve as a constant visual reminder of the language. Your brain will be absorbing the visual information without you really knowing. 5. Watch, read, listen Reading books and newspapers, watching a film or a TV programme, listening to a podcast or radio programme in your new language will really help you absorb the language more quickly. 6.

Alison provides an opportunity to those who are unable to work, or study in traditional third level institutions, to pursue their interests and up-skill, offering hope for the future and a whole world of possibility. Princess Khumalo from Zimbabwe arrived in Ireland in 2014, and is currently residing in a direct provision centre. “Before coming to Ireland, I was in the casino industry for 24 years.

This was never part of his dreams. Having spent years being cut off from the outside world due to lack of electricity, he has found his way into sustainable self-employment, with a proud display of entrepreneurial skills he learned with Alison free online learning. Qualified Electrician Evans was born in 1966 in the Republic of Zaire, a central African State, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo. As a young man he trained as an Electrician, passing the national exams in 1989 at the age of 23. His future seemed bright but Zaire was in a constant state of turmoil and change since Mobutu’s seizure of power with a Military coup in 1965. The state later collapsed (1996) with the destabilisation of eastern Zaire and the Rwandan Civil War. Life as a Refugee Just three years after receiving his certification as an electrician, at the age of 26, Evans was relocated to Dzaleka Refugee Camp, in Malawi, Africa; He is still there, 23 years later. Without electricity in most refugee camps, Evans education came to a halt, and life as he knew it became stagnant. He found himself struggling with thoughts of his future. He was alone in the world. Thankfully, he found happiness in love, and now with his wife, they have seven children. At the end of 2013, more than 136,000 refugees were listed in Southern Africa, and an additional 278,000 asylum seekers. The government, worried about human trafficking, national security, smuggling and just general abuse of the system, set up tighter border controls. This, in one sense protected the refugees, but also imprisoned them further. Nearly all subregional countries are party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and to the 1967 protocol, but for most living in refugee camps, life is pretty basic and very grim. Despite the deplorable living situation he found himself in, Evans managed to keep his thirst for knowledge and one day the lights came on, literally speaking. The refugee camp got electricity in 2012, nineteen years after he entered the refugee camp. Although the use of electricity was primarily for the main people running the refugee camp, it was with limited time and access to a shared computer that Evans found his way back into Education. Following a link on social media advertising free online education, he ended up on the Alison website and has not looked back since. Dzaleka Refugee Camp “I live in Dzaleka refugee camp; the highest persecution of life you can imagine. Alison is a gift to me and has allowed me to transform the way I think. Now I can focus on the management and entrepreneurship courses I have enrolled in.” Loving the challenges he faced with Alison’s free online courses, Evans became eager to better himself, in the hopes that he can provide a better life for him, his wife and their seven children. “I am not finished with Alison. I feel like I have really just started with a whole new life. I am learning online as much as possible and will get my Diploma in business management and entrepreneurship soon.” Evans has already put his learning into practice by taking the knowledge he has learned with Alison and in true entrepreneurial spirit, is sharing it with others. Evans’ advice to current and future learners: “Don’t lose heart. Don’t lose hope. I know it is not easy, trust me. If you are seeking education, and can’t for whatever reason. Be it a family situation preventing you from attending school, or you can’t afford it, or you have been displaced in life as a refugee (like me) due to political war, civil war or religious conflict, join the Alison learning community and just start learning! Allow yourself to prepare for the future. Become a leader and help ensure there is free education for everyone in the world.”","length":3861,"tokens":816,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"From Refugee to Entrepreneur with Free Online Learning","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/from-refugee-to-entrepreneur-with-free-online-learning","essay_date":"Apr 5, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Evans Mweemena Kamabwe will celebrate his fiftieth birthday in a few months and has been living in a refugee camp for 23 years.

The refugee camp got electricity in 2012, nineteen years after he entered the refugee camp. Although the use of electricity was primarily for the main people running the refugee camp, it was with limited time and access to a shared computer that Evans found his way back into Education. Following a link on social media advertising free online education, he ended up on the Alison website and has not looked back since.

I feel like I have really just started with a whole new life. I am learning online as much as possible and will get my Diploma in business management and entrepreneurship soon.” Evans has already put his learning into practice by taking the knowledge he has learned with Alison and in true entrepreneurial spirit, is sharing it with others. Evans’ advice to current and future learners: “Don’t lose heart. Don’t lose hope. I know it is not easy, trust me. If you are seeking education, and can’t for whatever reason. Be it a family situation preventing you from attending school, or you can’t afford it, or you have been displaced in life as a refugee (like me) due to political war, civil war or religious conflict, join the Alison learning community and just start learning!

We hate to break it to you, social media is here to stay and it’s only getting bigger. And if you’re in business, and are not investing time in social media, you could be losing your future customer-base as we speak. Here are our top tips for getting the most out of social media… Research – find out what social media platforms your customers and target customers are using, and how they’re using them. Are your customers using them purely as a personal social tool or are they buying and promoting online? Once you know where your customers are, make sure you’re there too. Research what your competitors are doing on social media – you could find some fascinating or surprising insights. Check out how market leaders in other industries use social media, and take note! Write up a social media plan – what do you want to get from social media? Set goals, deadlines and make sure you stick to your plan. Give the customer what they want – just like in business, on social media, you need to give the customer what they’re looking for. That could be quality content surrounding your product or the business you’re in, discounts, news of upcoming sales, events etc. Make sure that what you post is well thought out, well written and engaging. It also needs to add value for the customer, so no cute baby videos or adorable puppy pics (unless you have a baby store or run kennels). Remember that what you post is how your brand is going to be seen, so make sure to align yourself with the message that you want to get across. Remember to engage. Simply having an account on Twitter doesn’t mean you use Twitter. Whichever platforms you choose to use, make sure you update regularly.

In a recent study of Alison graduates in Nigeria, 17% declared that they had secured a new job, a promotion, an interview or their career was boosted as a result of studying with Alison. In addition, 63% said that completing an Alison course gave them an edge in the workplace and improved their workplace skills. Keep your end goal in mind and that will help motivate you to complete the course.","content_length":1247,"content_tokens":256,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"5 Surprising Psychological Benefits of Exercise","url":"https://alison.com/blog/5-surprising-psychological-benefits-exercise","date":"Apr 2, 2021","thanks":"","content":"We all know that exercise is great for our physical health – it keeps us fit and healthy and less likely to suffer from heart problems, diabetes, and a long list of other illnesses, but many people are taking up exercise for its psychological benefits too. A Happier You Exercise increases endorphins, the feel good chemicals that are often referred to as ‘runner’s high’. Ever noticed how, no matter how bad you feel when you go out the door and start moving, 99 times out of 100, you feel a whole lot better afterwards? Exercise acts like a magic wand for low moods. Some experts even believe that in the long term it actually keeps mental illness such as depression at bay. A More Confident You Exercise is great for self-esteem. Firstly, there’s the change you’ll see in your body, which will automatically make you feel better about yourself, but there’s also the sense of achievement that comes with it …the ‘I did it’ moments that you thought you’d never reach. Reaching milestones, achieving goals, pushing yourself further and feeling stronger every week will work wonders for your self esteem. A More Sociable You Taking part in sport exposes you to people you normally wouldn’t meet in your personal or work life. Meeting people from different walks of life, of different ages, and all with a common interest is a wonderfully freeing and enriching experience. A Smarter You Exercise makes your mind sharper, makes your responses and reflexes quicker and your judgement sounder. It also improves your concentration. Great news for your professional life! A More Relaxed You Exercise is a fantastic stress reliever. Throw your worries into the intensity of your workouts and watch your worries fade away. Getting outside in the fresh air, getting your body moving, or simply letting your brain rest while you exercise is on par with meditation. In fact, exercise is a form of meditation.

You’ve been updating it from time to time when a job comes up. You’ve managed to get it down to two pages. You think it’s fine…think again! The majority of résumés are simply a list of your past work and educational history…and this can make for pretty boring reading if you consider that the person who’s reading your résumé probably has a few hundred to get through. So, assuming that you have the basics of a neat, coherent, succinct and well-written (and correctly spelt) one-page résumé, but are still having problems getting called to interview, here is Alison’s guide to making your résumé stand out from the crowd. Be a Winning Salesperson You’re essentially marketing yourself through your résumé, and offering a list of your past experiences doesn’t even come near to showcasing what an amazing team worker you are, or what a creative problem-solver you are, or how your passion and determination inspire everyone on your team. So tell them! In a few lines, at the top of résumé, sell yourself. Be honest and truthful, but remember you want them to sit up and take notice of you. Spend time on this; it’s the most important three lines in your résumé. They want to know what you can do for the company, what you can bring and how you will fit in. Focus on the Employer’s Needs Your potential employers don’t care how getting this job will make you happy – not yet anyway. They want to know what you can do for the company, what you can bring and how you will fit in. Address the employers’ needs and let them know what you can do for them. Include this in the first few lines as above. Include other Achievements & Skills in your Résumé So you won an award – put that in your résumé. If you’ve been taking the initiative on furthering your education and interests through continued learning, mention that as well. Continued learning shows initiative, a curiosity about the world around you and a drive to constantly improve and upskill yourself – things every employer is looking for in an employee. So mention any courses you’ve undertaken online and otherwise. Also be sure to mention any soft skills you have, as they are transferable to just about any position. Knowing more than one language is a big advantage in today’s global market. So if you have them, list them in your résumé! Volunteering shows community spirit and an interest in the greater good. Hobbies in a Résumé – Forget it! Just don’t go there. The fact that you go out running on a Saturday morning is great for you, but will it have any bearing on your job? The only extracurricular activities you should include are those that benefit others. So, if you like to spend your Saturday morning down at the soup kitchen, share that. Volunteering shows community spirit and an interest in the greater good, which translates well in a business environment. Remember that your résumé is an advert about you. You don’t want to over-embellish and over-promise, but you do want potential employers to know how great you really are. So forget humility and modesty and sell, sell, sell like you’ve never sold before!","length":3144,"tokens":720,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"How to Create a Winning Résumé","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/create-winning-resume","essay_date":"Apr 1, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"So you compiled your first résumé five or ten years ago.

Among the series of MS applications, the top ones are – Excel for spreadsheets, Outlook for email, Powerpoint for visual presentations, and Word for desktop publishing.

You see, when I first started taking Alison courses I kept finding them either too hard or too easy. As a result, I didn’t finish the courses, and after a little while I felt disappointed with my progress. But then I realised that I was doing a few things wrong. These were really small things, but they made a big difference. Now that I’ve corrected them, finishing courses is much easier. So, I decided to share with you a few things that I try to remember when I’m finishing my courses. These are just from my personal experience, but I really hope they help you too! 1. It gets harder Some courses start out easy. Really easy. At first, I thought this meant that the course was going to stay at this level the entire way through. So, thinking that I was too advanced for the course, I would give up and try a new one. This turned out to be a mistake. Alison courses are designed to cater to all skill levels, particularly their Learning Paths. Many of them bring total beginners all the way up to advanced skills. Just because they start easy, doesn’t mean they stay that way, so stick with them. 2. Skipping stuff you already know is not a good idea Sometimes you find a topic or a concept in a course that you are already familiar with. This happened to me when I took a photography course. So, I skipped ahead until I got to a topic I was completely unfamiliar with. But then, I couldn’t understand this new topic at all. It turned out that all the stuff I needed to understand this new topic was included inside the sections that I had skipped. So I stopped skipping sections, and it really helped. 3. Refresh older topics, it helps Even if you just did a topic yesterday, and especially if you covered it a few days or a week ago, when you resume your course the first thing you should do is look over the topics you just did. This isn’t because you’ve forgotten them (although, you might have). It’s because by going over the information again you can actually trick your brain into thinking it needs to learn this stuff again, and this helps you to remember things for longer! (something I learned from a psychology course) 4. Do Certificate courses first, then Diplomas Certificate courses should be done for the same reason that you shouldn’t skip the easier topics within courses. Even if you think you know everything in the course, there is definitely something in there that will make it easier to get through Diploma courses. And besides, Certificate courses take less than 3 hours, so it’s a small step towards making your next course a success. 5. The certification is a great motivator The first time I finished a course, I didn’t buy a certificate. A few weeks later, Alison sent me an email reminding me that I could get one, and I thought “ok, why not.” So I bought one and put it on my desk. Within 3 days I had finished another course. Just having that certification in front of me actually really motivated me to keep going with my next course, because it reminded me of my achievement and what I was working towards. If you don’t have one, definitely get one, I think it really helps.","length":3266,"tokens":725,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"5 Things to Remember When Trying to Finish Online Courses","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/5-things-to-remember-when-trying-to-finish-online-courses","essay_date":"Mar 19, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"By Francisco P. – As I’ve been taking my Alison courses, I’ve been learning little things that really help me to finish online courses and get certified.

If you don’t have one, definitely get one, I think it really helps.","content_length":817,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Alison’s Top 10 Most Popular Diploma Courses of 2018","url":"https://alison.com/blog/alisons-top-10-most-popular-diploma-courses-of-2018","date":"Mar 18, 2021","thanks":"","content":"Looking to start a new course, but don’t know what to choose?

I am not very healthy. It’s nothing serious. I don’t need to go to hospital or have emergency treatment. It’s not that bad. But I need to accept that I am not in good shape. I regularly need to buy new clothes, I feel tired and inactive, I don’t look forward to walking around, and I am not happy with what I look like. But this is going to change. The first thing I did was admit I was not in good shape. Then, I decided to do something about it. So, I started reading about health and fitness, and then I started making some changes to my diet and to my daily routine. I walk a little more, I eat a little less, and I eat a little different. This feels good. But I don’t just feel good because I’m eating differently or acting differently. I feel good because for the first time in a long time I am in control of my health. I have this control because, alongside my diet and exercise, I am taking Alison’s course on Diet and Nutrition. This course is giving me more than a list of instructions for dieting. It’s teaching me why certain things are healthy and why others are not. It’s teaching me what these previously meaningless words (proteins, carbohydrates) actually mean. Now, when I go shopping and when I eat, I understand why I am choosing this food. I understand what is going into my body. This gives me a sense of control over my health that I never had before. This started when a friend of mine asked me “why are you eating more salmon?” All I could say was, “it’s healthy.” He asked me why, and I realised I had no idea. I just sort of thought “it looks healthy.” But then I realised that I had no good reason to think this. Did I just see an advertisement for salmon? Did I see someone who looked healthy eating salmon? Why did I think it was healthy? Knowledge is power, and without knowledge I felt really powerless. And I never realised that this lack of knowledge was one of the things that was making me feel this way. The course I’m taking is also guiding me through really important issues like life expectancy and healthcare. These make me more confident that what I am doing for my body now will have long term benefits. I cannot tell you what a relief this has been. I can go shopping and have dinner knowing that I am making good choices. That really has made all the difference. I just wish I had done all of this sooner, before I gained so many pounds! I suppose what I’ve learned the most is this: No matter who you are or how healthy you feel, it’s never to early or too late to take control of your diet. That control starts with knowledge.

If you don’t dream, very little in your life can change or improve. Dreamers can fix problems, raise families, build homes, and make small but important improvements to their lives. You’re a dreamer, that’s why you’re here. You have what it takes to get started. But dreaming isn’t enough. Once you know where you want to go, you have to go there. That takes motivation. It’s not easy. Many of us start a project, or a course, or even just a plan, and don’t finish it. But you can do it, even if you don’t think you can. Here are some tips for motivating yourself, and others that have really helped me turn dreams into realities. 1. Write Down Why Many of us dreamers get motivated sometimes. We see that new skill or new career that can make things better, and we want to chase it. The problem is, this feeling fades. And when it fades, we are more likely to give up. A great way to stop this from happening is to write down exactly why you want to do something and put it somewhere visible. See that note everyday, remember why you started, and get that initial motivation back! 2. Scheduling Not scheduling, or scheduling badly, can result in your day just being way too full. When too many commitments all need your attention at the same time, you can lose your motivation to stick with your other projects. But you can make a plan and manage your time around it, and that can make a huge difference! Start scheduling better and feel your motivation improve. 3. Expect Slow Progress Did you ever start a project, but after a while you still didn’t feel like you had achieved anything? Don’t worry, that’s not your fault! It’s a fact of life: nothing worth having comes quickly. You have to make it to the end of a project or a course before you gain what you wanted at the beginning. Everything between the beginning and the end is slow, sometimes annoyingly slow, but necessary. Don’t expect results too fast, and stick with it! 4. Work in Pairs Giving up on yourself is much easier than giving up on somebody else. When someone is relying on you, you will keep your commitments to them more than you keep commitments to yourself. Find someone to work with, to study with, to diet with, whatever it is. Arrange specific times to meet, even just an online meeting to share each other’s progress and what you have learned. By sticking with each other, your motivation for the project will stay strong. I really hope you find these tips helpful, and if you think they might help someone you know please share this blog with them!

This was years ago, before I knew about good online courses for learning a language. All I had was books. That’s right, books! Those weird old things from the time before iPhones and computers the size of your hand. And I really did not like it. Whenever I finished a chapter of a book, I closed the last page and said “Yes! I’m done!” When I finished the last page of the last book, I was just so happy. I was learning English because my family was moving to England. In February, we got on the plane, a few hours later I was in London, and a few hours after that I realised I could not speak English. I could not understand a single sentence anybody was saying. It was a complete disaster. How had I failed so badly?! Let me tell you four things I did really badly, so that you won’t make the same mistakes. 1. I only read books Reading and writing are only a small part of a language. When you are using a language, you are usually speaking and listening, so you have to learn these skills. This is much easier now with online courses. After you’ve practiced these skills with your course, try to speak the language for 15 minutes a day, and then listen to a song or movie in that language at least once a week. It makes a really big difference. 2. I only did each topic once When I finished a topic, I just started a new topic. I never went back to the old ones, and this was a big mistake. Language is learned through repetition. Once you learn something, you have to learn it again. This is actually not that difficult. If you learn something for the first time, it’s hard, but if you do it again then it’s much easier. By repeating courses and sections of courses, the whole language seems a lot less challenging. 3. I did not start at the beginning I spoke a little English before I started trying to learn it properly. So I skipped the beginner courses and just went straight to the middle. Not a good idea. Even if you think you can speak the language a little bit already, start with those beginner courses, then move up to intermediate and then to the advanced ones. They might seem easy, and if they do, great! But somewhere in these courses you will learn something important you did not know before. You can’t skip any stage! 4. I thought I could finish The entire time I was learning English, I was trying to finish. But you can never finish learning a new language. Even now I am learning new vocabulary at work and on the news, and I still make little mistakes all the time. And lifelong learning is actually quite nice. There is always something new to discover, and with language that means every day you can find a better way to express yourself. That is a real joy So, no matter where you are on your language learning journey, keep going. You will never be truly finished, but that’s a great thing.

However, changing careers can also be exciting. Trying something completely new is never going to be easy, but the rewards could also be really, really big. Here are some tips to help you find a career you love. 1. Ask “What do I love doing right now?” Before you find a new career, you have to know what you want. So, make a list of all the things you like and don’t like about your current job. Think about daily tasks, deadlines, and challenges. What aspect of your job excites you? What aspects do you really dislike? Putting this on paper will help you make a plan. 2. Ask “What do I dream about doing?” If you could do anything, what would it be? Try not to think too seriously – just let yourself dream for a minute. For instance, if you love reading fiction, did you ever consider a career as a writer or a journalist? Or maybe an author? What is your dream? 3. Talk to Friends and Family Get help from friends or family who you can talk to. They might also have some ideas about what they think you would be really good at. You don’t need to do exactly what they say, but it might get you thinking about other options. 4. Get Networking Get out there and start meeting different people who have similar interests to you. This will help you make new contacts, and possibly new friends. Widening your network will make it easier to discover the thing that you love. 5. Find a Career Coach Working with a coach or mentor can be a great source of career guidance. The decision to change careers shouldn’t be done too quickly, so the more research and time you put into planning your career path, the better. This research will make sure you will have the info you need to make the right decision. 6. Research Careers Get online and read as much as you can about the careers you’re interested in, and then try a variety of free courses related to those careers. There’s no better way to find out if something is for you than by trying it, and even better if you can do so for free. For instance, do you have what it takes to become an entrepreneur? What about a career in IT or photography? After you study one course, you might learn that area is not for you. This really helps you make the right decision. 7. Upskill Once you’ve found the general area you’re interested in, upskilling is the best way to get you to the next level. Alison offers over 1,000 free online courses that are interactive and easy to use at both Certificate and Diploma level. It takes no financial commitment, and you can study in your own time, while still maintaining your current hours at work. So, you know what to do, now start doing it!

Sometimes, it might feel like stress can take over everything. If you have too much to do, or have a big worry on your mind, anxiety can come into every other moment of your day. This constant strain can make life feel a lot heavier than it should. So how can you destress when life just becomes a little overwhelming? There are ways to help make your days a little easier. I’ve been there myself, and was surprised to learn that really little things can make a big difference to the day. I’m not an expert, but here’s a quick list of tricks that help me destress when I feel a little overwhelmed. 1. Make a plan, and then think in the moment A major source of stress is having too many things to do. Sometimes, you can’t change the fact that you have to do all these things. But, we don’t actually have to think about all of these things at the same time. At the start of your day, make a plan for the day. After that, only think about the thing you are doing right now. You don’t have to think about all that other stuff until you are finished the current task. 2. Listen to some comedy whenever you can Laughing, I think, is the single biggest stress reliever in the world. If you laugh now and then, it can really improve your overall mood. Download some stand-up comedy on your phone and listen to it on your commute, your lunch break, or while working on something that isn’t too hard. If you’re at home, put something funny on the TV and just leave it in the background. You might only catch one or two funny bits, but they are worth it. 3. Destress? Drink tea! “But I don’t like tea!” That’s what I said, but it turns out there is a huge range of teas out there. Ginger, camomile, green, turmeric, fruit flavoured, assam – there is a flavour for everyone! Tea is not only healthy, it’s also really relaxing. Even if you drink while working, taking slow sips of a warm, tasty drink can slow your heart rate and just calm you down that little bit. 4. Record the good things When you’re stressed, your brain will actually forget the positive things in your life. I find that taking pictures of good moments, or writing them down even in a note in my phone, really helps. In the evening, or when you are feeling too overwhelmed, check your photo gallery or notes. You just might be surprised at the good things that happened this week. 5. Talk to people, they can help! These are just my tips, which I’ve learned from experience. The thing is, almost everyone has experience with managing stress. Talk to your friends and family, and see what advice they have. You never know what you might learn.","length":2685,"tokens":641,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Five Ways You Can Destress Just A Little","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/five-ways-you-can-destress-just-a-little","essay_date":"Mar 12, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"By Priya P. – Stress is a part of life, but sometimes it can be way too big a part.

M. Waqas Imam – When a consumer decides to buy groceries from a store, or when a hospital procures surgical instruments for medical procedures, their foremost concern is the quality of the product. This quality is negatively impacted by any variability in the product. As such, companies need to reduce inconsistencies in order to manage product quality. To do so, they use quality management systems for standardization. When it comes to standardization, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a global benchmark. In particular the ISO 9001, which was built by amalgamating global best practices for quality management systems, now sets the international standard for developing and maintaining these systems. This is a voluntary standard that sets both corporate giants and small companies with certain minimum requirements for their quality management systems. Organizations that adopt these standards gain their customers’ trust in the quality of their product. The standard for ISO 9001 was revised in September 2015, and the new version involved vital changes and the adoption of new concepts that offer a systematic way to handle strategic quality management issues. Organizations looking to sustain and expand their market share are strongly advised to implement the new requirements and concepts.

M. Waqas Imam – ISO 9001 is the world’s most widely used standard among both small and big corporations, vendors and industries. It is applicable to every business model, from an ice cream parlor to a giant steel manufacturing firm. It provides the minimum requirements for companies to create and maintain effective quality management systems, and in doing so boost customer satisfaction. In September 2015 ISO 9001 was significantly revised from its 2008 version. It is vital for industrial professionals to learn those changes and the fundamental concepts behind them, so that they can upgrade their systems to the latest version. Since the transition period ends in September 2018, companies and industries have little time to learn these concepts and make this upgrade. Different training bodies offer expensive training programs for the implementation, auditing, and internal auditing of this new standard. These training bodies include BSI (British Standards Institution), Bureau Veritas, TUV Rheinland, and SGS International. However, these programs are designed for people already at an advanced level, so those lacking basic knowledge will find it difficult to comprehend these training programs. Some of the most well-known training programs for ISO 9001:2015 are listed below: 1. ISO 9001:2015 Fundamental Concepts 2. ISO 9001:2015 – Lead Auditor Transition Training Course 3.

In case of failures, candidates can retake the exam without any additional fee. The course material is always available for the trainees so that they can refer to it even after completion and certification. Upon completion of this course, professionals can assist in the implementation of the new requirements of the standard, and will be prepared to attend lead auditor and internal auditor courses which are difficult to pass without prior knowledge of the standard. ISO 9001:2015 Foundations Course and ISO 9001:2015 Awareness and Implementation Training are basic courses that lay the groundwork for beginners, as well as middle and top managers, who lack awareness of ISO 9001. These courses cover the basics of ISO 9001, and normally take one working day (i. e. 7-8 hours) along with exercises, group activities and discussions. Trainees must make themselves available during the given session. The courses usually do not have any exam or assessment. ISO 9001:2015 Internal Auditor Training Course is an intermediate level course and focuses on internal auditing of the system. This course prepares professionals for the internal audit process in any organization. Trainees must ensure they attend the course during specific defined hours.

When’s the last time you felt really inspired? Did it happen this week? This month? Last year? Sometimes, we can go through long periods without feeling any great boost of inspiration. That’s nothing to worry about, life is just like that sometimes. But recently I realised that it had been a really long time since I had been able to find inspiration, and I thought “is there a way to change that?” It turns out, there is. Most of the time inspiration takes you completely by surprise. But there are actually things you can do to invite a little more inspiration into your life. Discovering this was a lovely boost for me- it is just really nice when something comes along that makes you go “Wow”. What’s more, if you can find inspiration then that can be the great kick you need to start doing something really fulfilling. So, here are a few tips that you can use to find inspiration a little more often. 1. Walk with a camera Most of us have a small walk at some point in our day. And if you don’t, try to squeeze in a walk on the weekend, it’s great for your health! When you take your walk, whether it’s through an urban centre or out in the countryside, bring a digital camera. Trying to take the perfect shot of your surroundings is a great way to bring out the beauty and spot what’s inspiring in any place. 2. Design your ideal tattoo You don’t have to get a tattoo! But designing the tattoo you would get, can actually be a great source of inspiration. Try to design an image that really means something to you. Maybe it represents you, or is a reminder of a big event or important person in your life. Whatever it is, just thinking about it can bring a little inspiration to mind (even if you have no intention of getting the tattoo!). 3. Books books books You only live one life, but with a pile of books you can get inspiration from the lives of thousands of others. There are so many amazing authors and texts out there full of incredible and inspiring stories. Check them out, and get a little bit of wonder into your day. 4. Discover history Fiction can be so moving, but true stories can be even better. Learning about the real things that incredible people did during important and really interesting periods in history is a great source of inspiration. And by looking at the past, you can learn so much about your future. 5. Find art you love A great piece of art can evoke powerful emotions when you look at it. Different people find inspiration from different art, so introduce yourself to a nice wide range of artists and discover which type of art makes you feel something strong. With these little tips, you can invite some more inspiration into your life. That can be a really nice boost that makes life a bit more enjoyable. So give it a go, you never know what you might find!","length":2815,"tokens":617,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"5 Really Great Ways to Find Inspiration","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/5-really-great-ways-to-find-inspiration","essay_date":"Mar 7, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"By Priya P.

There is something in my house I am scared of. It’s a totally normal item. It’s a game actually, my kids play it all the time. I used to play it, and I really liked it, especially because the kids found it so fun. But over the last few years, I’ve liked it less and less, and eventually I became literally afraid of it. I’m talking about our game of Twister. For anyone who doesn’t know, Twister is a game where you and some friends are told to bend yourselves into ridiculous positions. If someone falls down, they are out of the game. Usually when someone falls down, everyone else falls with them, and it’s hilarious. But not for me. Recently, as I’ve lost my fitness, I’ve just become completely incapable of bending at all. The game is, quite simply, embarrassing for me. So, I told a friend of mine that I wanted to fix this, that I wanted to get more in shape, and they recommended learning yoga. Honestly, I was a little unsure at first. I’ve done stretching exercises before, not regularly but sometimes, and they never helped me that much. But my friend told me to try yoga for a full month before giving up. So I did, and now I cannot recommend it highly enough. One of the things that’s great about yoga is that literally anyone can start it. Trust me, I am not a fit person at the moment. There are no yoga poses that I can do completely right. Most of them, I can’t do at all. But I can try to do all of them, and that’s enough. You see, yoga is all about stretching. You find out what’s the maximum you can do right now, and you try to go beyond that. Just trying (and trying over and over again) means that next time, you will be able to go a little further. Over time, I’ve noticed I’m becoming a little more flexible, and things that were tough are not so hard anymore. But yoga has improved more than my flexibility. This surprised me, but yoga is actually really relaxing. Yes, exercise that’s relaxing. Sounds strange, but it’s true. Apparently, yoga gets your body rhythms into a nice order, so that internally everything feels a little bit more balanced. This has really helped my sense of calm during my day, which is really nice. The most important thing here is sticking with it. Yoga, like any kind of self-improvement journey, gives you more benefits the longer you stick with it, and not many benefits if you only do it now and then. Because I had to do it for a full month before I could give up, I actually started to see that those benefits would slowly enter my life if I kept going. Now that I’m doing it continuously, I’m getting the rewards. I plan on sticking with this for a long time. I know that the more I do it, the bigger the rewards will be for my physical and psychological health. As a parting thought, what is the biggest thing I’ve learned from yoga, and something I want to apply to the rest of my life? Doing something helpful sometimes doesn’t help much, but doing something helpful continuously helps more and more each day.","length":2987,"tokens":713,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Why I Decided To Start and Stick With Yoga","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/why-i-decided-to-start-and-stick-with-yoga","essay_date":"Mar 6, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"By Omar B.

Sitting on a bus, writing data into a spreadsheet, cleaning the house: this is not what life is supposed to be about! Life routine is important. There are certain things we just have to do, and we have to do regularly. But that doesn’t mean we can’t have space for something different sometimes. Making life a little more interesting is important. It keeps things fun, and it gives you something to look forward to during your day. When your boss is really annoying you, or your family is just driving you crazy, it’s great to be able to say to yourself “later today, I get to do x.” But what is that x? What is that little thing you can use to make life a little bit less routine? Here’s five quick ideas. 1. Start learning an instrument Learning an instrument really makes life more interesting. That’s because once you start, you will be learning for life. There will never be a point where you can say “I’m finished, I’ve learned it all.” Instead, every day you can find a new tune, a new rhythm, a new lyric to go with your music. And even though you can learn forever, you can start pretty quickly with a few tips and a helpful course. 2. Take up photography Photography can make everything and anything that little bit different. Even the most ordinary things can seem extraordinary when you are trying to take a cool picture of them. Lots of photography exhibitions are just of everyday items on the side of the street! So, get a camera, learn how it works, and turn your commute home from work into something interesting. 3. Find someone to learn a language with If you’ve ever tried to learn a language, you know that speaking speaking speaking is the key to getting it right. A great way to add to your language course is to find someone who is fluent in that language and meet them once or twice a week to speak with them. It might be in person or over the internet, but that weekly meeting can actually be something really nice to look forward to, and really helpful for your language learning! 4. Learn some new recipes Most people cook the same meals again and again and again. There is nothing wrong with that. Cooking is a necessity, and often you want it to be quick and easy. But if you spend just a little bit of time learning about nutrition and diet, you might be able to try one new recipe a week to make your food that little bit different. 5. Sign up to a marathon Ok, maybe not a full marathon. But there are so many little exercise routines available that you can do with other people. Group activity is the key here. Meeting up sometimes with people who are all training for a marathon or a race or just doing some fitness activities together can give you something to look forward to, a new aspect to your social life, and also a sense of achievement. These are just a few ideas, maybe you have your own. What’s important is just to give something a try, especially if you’ve never done it before.

Maybe you did manage to start a course, but then missed a day because you were too busy. You wanted to do it the next day, but then something else got in the way. Soon, it’s been a week, two weeks, a month, and you haven’t made much progress at all. Don’t stress about this, it’s actually completely normal! So many of us are really busy, and just can’t find the time for all the parts of life that need our attention. Work, family, friends, education; they all demand your time. But, with a few simple time management techniques, you can maximise the time you spend on each part of your life. Here’s a few tips to help you get started. 1. Get a notepad No fancy computer programs, no expensive scheduler. Just a little flip notepad and a pen in your favourite colour. In the morning, write down all the things you need and want to do. Set a limit to the amount of time you can spend on each one. When you get new things to do, write them down immediately. When you finish something, scratch it off, and really enjoy scratching it off. It’s simple, and a great way to relieve stress. 2. Schedule some blank space and hold on to it Make sure that each day has some blank space scheduled in. Some parts of your day might take longer than you think, so you might need that extra breathing room. If your time with family or at work runs a little long, that’s ok. You scheduled for that extra time, so you can relax. But remember, keep that space blank for as long as possible! 3. Don’t be afraid to tell people you are busy There are lots of people who will ask you to do something more in your day. Some are easy to say no to, some are hard. But everybody can accept that if your day is full, then it is full. And don’t worry! If you tell most people that you are just too busy at the moment, they will understand. Most people will know that some days are just busier than others. 4. Don’t always skip the same thing Eventually, you will miss something. It happens, don’t worry. Work was busier than usual, your child just needed a lot from you today, and something had to be skipped. The trick is: don’t always skip the same thing. If you skipped out on family time yesterday, don’t do that today. If you missed your course twice this week, definitely not today! That way, nothing ever gets completely dropped. If you can use these time management techniques, not only will you guarantee some space for your learning a few times a week, you will also feel a lot calmer and in control of your day. That can be a real boost.

We try to set goals, but then we can’t think of any good ones. Or maybe we do set goals that we like, but then we forget about them or can’t find a way to complete them. This can be really frustrating, because great goals are actually really helpful. A well-planned set of targets can motivate you, keep you focused, and lead to some achievements you can be proud of. But a poorly-planned goal is just a source of disappointment. It took a long time before I learned how make better goals for myself. And I didn’t just learn this on my own, I was given a lot of helpful tips from nice people. Sharing information is just so helpful, so I thought I would share a few things I’ve learned with you! So, here’s a quick list of my favourite tricks for setting great goals. 1. Make sure it’s goals you really want to achieve Something I did wrong for a long time was turn passing ideas into goals. One day, I would suddenly think “I would love to learn a new language.” And then I would say “Ok, let’s see if I can learn Spanish this year.” But it wasn’t long before I lost my motivation. That wasn’t because I was lazy. It was because I actually didn’t really want to learn a new language, it was just a little idea I had one day. When you set a goal, make sure it’s something you really want. When I eventually decided I wanted to learn yoga, it was because I really wanted to achieve the health benefits of yoga. With that motivation, I was able to take a yoga course and stick with it! 2. Make it a progressive goal with rewards Having a reward in sight is a great source of motivation, so try to set goals that can be achieved in pieces. If you want to lose weight, try to lose a certain amount per month. If you want to learn a language, try to master one grammar point every two weeks. Whenever you achieve that little part of your overall goal, give yourself a little reward. If no part is too big then every part will be achievable. And when you’ve completed them all, you’ve achieved your goal! 3. Keep your goal secret from everyone else Did you know that if you announce your goals publicly you are much less likely to achieve them? This is a strange psychological trick your brain plays on you. When you announce your goals you often feel proud of yourself. That premature pride (you haven’t completed your goals yet) can actually lower your motivation. So when you are setting your goals, tell your close family at most, maybe just your partner or best friend. Then, keep it a secret! 4. Plan your time immediately Part of setting a great goal is figuring out if you can fit it into your schedule. Before you say “Ok, this is my goal” make sure you can actually make time for it. Something I used to do a lot was think “I am going to do this” and then realise later that I definitely did not have the time for this. Time management is crucial here, so a short bit of time management training can really help you not only set great goals, but complete them as well. I really hope you find this helpful.

We try to set goals, but then we can’t think of any good ones. Or maybe we do set goals that we like, but then we forget about them or can’t find a way to complete them. This can be really frustrating, because great goals are actually really helpful. A well-planned set of targets can motivate you, keep you focused, and lead to some achievements you can be proud of. But a poorly-planned goal is just a source of disappointment. It took a long time before I learned how make better goals for myself. And I didn’t just learn this on my own, I was given a lot of helpful tips from nice people. Sharing information is just so helpful, so I thought I would share a few things I’ve learned with you!

That wasn’t because I was lazy. It was because I actually didn’t really want to learn a new language, it was just a little idea I had one day.

It’s not always easy to stay calm, and there can be so many different sources of frustration in your professional life. There might be too many things to do at the same time. Some of your colleagues could be really irritating, or unhelpful. Your boss might be too hard on you, or too unaware of all the things you have to do. The possibilities of stress at work can be endless. But sometimes, the most difficult thing is not finishing your work, or managing your colleagues, or dealing with your boss: it’s just staying calm. If you are not calm, if all of that stress, frustration, and anger comes up, then the rest of your work will suffer and your problems will get worse. And more importantly, staying calm just feels better than staying frustrated. Here’s a few things I do to stay calm at work, maybe they will be helpful for you as well. Develop your communication skills A lot of frustrating problems at work can be managed by communicating really well, both before and after the problem arises. By learning some simple communications skills, you can explain tasks more clearly and express your frustrations more directly and effectively. This prevents a lot of problems from arising and continuing. Then, if someone else still manages to mess up, you can manage the situation through the perfect choice of words. This can give you a real sense of control where previously there was only irritation. Remember that everyone is trying Did you know that the most popular online courses are almost all about developing business skills? Millions of people around the world are putting a lot of effort into improving their performance at work. Sure, some people aren’t really trying. But if you remember that most people really are giving it their all, then you will feel less frustrated and more inclined to give constructive and motivational advice when they mess up. This can really help your sense of calm and their productivity. Frustration means wait Feelings make us want to do things. We feel hungry, we think “eat”. We feel in love, we think “say I love you.” A lot of our feelings motivate positive behaviour, but did you know that frustration can make people want to do unwise things? Psychologically speaking, the best thing you can do when you feel frustrated is wait. Don’t take big actions, don’t make big speeches. Take some time, even just a few short breaths or a quick tea break. Let your emotions die down and then act. Almost always, this will make you calm down faster than if you continue acting while frustrated. Have something to look forward to Finally, if work is just too much stress to handle, make sure you have something nice to look forward to when you come home. Start a hobby, learn a new skill, find a great book; just have something great waiting for you at home so that if you ever get really stressed at work you can say to yourself “in just a few hours, I’ll be doing what I really enjoy.” I find that really helps. If these tips seem helpful, do share the post with others. You never know whose life you may have just improved.","length":3108,"tokens":661,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"4 Things You Can Do To Keep Calm At Work","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/4-things-you-can-do-to-keep-calm-at-work","essay_date":"Mar 3, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"By Priya P. – Sometimes, work is work.

I am actually really excited about this, I’ve wanted to learn a music instrument for a while. Whenever I see people playing an instrument I think “that looks great, I’d love to be able to do something like that.” But I’ve never been able to figure out how to get started. Then, about two months ago I talked to a friend of mine who is in a band, and shortly after I talked to the rest of the band. I asked them all how they got started playing music, and I actually learned some really interesting things that have been very helpful! Sure, some of them said “I’ve been playing since I was a kid.” But three of them actually only started playing when they were much older, and now they are all really good. Here’s what they shared with me, hopefully it will be of help to you as well! 1. Try A LOT of instruments first You might think you want to learn the guitar, or the violin. And maybe these really are the right instruments for you. The thing is, most people never even consider or try out more than one or two instruments in their life. That is a big mistake. The first thing you need to do is go to your nearest music shop and try EVERYTHING there. Just blowing into a flute, or hitting some drums, might make you realise something you never knew before: “I like this instrument.” 2. Know that you will be terrible in the beginning A lot of people tell you this, but it’s so easy to forget. In the beginning you will not be good. In fact, you will be terrible. Almost every note you make will sound wrong. Don’t let this get you down, you have to keep your motivation during that first month. Just understand that this is normal. It doesn’t mean you are bad, it means you are learning, and that is something to be proud of. Keep going, soon things will sound better. 3. Learn the rules of music (they are not mysterious) How do some people just play music? Is it a secret talent? Something they are born with? There is no doubt that some people have musical gifts. But believe it or not, music is actually mostly based on rules that anybody can learn! These rules are really simple, and information about them is easily available and can be learned in just a few hours. By putting in that little bit of time, music will seem a lot less mysterious, and your musical ability will improve a lot faster. 4. Copy your favourite easy songs first, then progress So many people want to write their own songs, or create their own rhythms. Everyone is in a rush to get to the exciting stuff in music. But the reality is you have to do the basics first. There are smart ways to learn, and bad ways to learn. The smart way is actually very simple: start with the easiest stuff that you already kind of know. When you are perfect at those things, then you can progress to the really cool stuff. I’ve been following these guidelines for the last month, and I am happy to say that I am definitely getting better and don’t think I will be giving up any time soon.

Research what skills you really need Many people hear about a skill that sounds interesting, or cool, and think “I’d love to be able to do that”.

Talk things out with others Before you launch into things, talk about your plan with some close friends or colleagues. Communicating well can be a great source of new ideas. You never know what advice you might get from other people, so have that conversation and see if you learn something. Take a time management course Before you start any skills course, take a time management course. There is just no point in making a study plan if you can’t manage your time well.

I have four years of experience in the community development sector, specifically focused on peace-building and empowering women. I graduated from Nasarawa State University with a degree in Religious Studies. I have a background in telecommunications and am the founder of the House of Hilkiah Foundation, a non-profit organization focused on empowering women and providing formal and informal education and skills acquisition to young people. I am a certified sexual and gender-based violence instructor and am also the Benue State coordinator of Education 4 Justice, a project run by the United Nations Office On Drugs and Crime(UNODC).” How did you learn about Alison? When coronavirus was declared a global pandemic by the WHO, I was still trying to understand what exactly it was all about. In March 2020, Alison’s Coronavirus: What you need to know course was shared in a WhatsApp group that I am a member of. That’s when I first learned about Alison. I took the course because my team and I were trying to raise awareness of the virus to help flatten the curve in the rural communities we work in. What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? Coronavirus: What you need to know was the first course I took on Alison. I choose the course to gain knowledge about the virus, preventive measures and how we can help stop the spread in our community through raising awareness. How have Alison courses affected your career? After taking the course on coronavirus, we were able to translate the information into local languages which we then distributed to vulnerable rural communities together with handwash buckets, locally made sanitizers, face masks and soap. Because of this act I was given an honorary mention award and mini-grant of $250 by the Union Bank of Nigeria, as well as a Corona Warrior award by the National Human Welfare Organization in India. This motivated us to continue the work to include more communities in Nigeria. What’s your favorite way to relax from studying? I love watching movies or reading romantic novels. Where are you working and what are you studying at the moment? I am currently running the House of Hilkiah Foundation where we are working towards achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. We just launched a new project, Educate for Greatness, to ensure that every child has the right to education, especially those in rural areas. Right now, I am taking a course on depression and how to identify it, which will help us in providing support to children who are facing mental health challenges. What’s next for you, in terms of education or work? Researching the best policies to facilitate involving youths in peace and conflict resolution in Nigeria. If you could learn absolutely anything in the world from an Alison course, what would it be? How to involve young people in peace and mediation processes. What would you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? Would you recommend it and why? Alison has some of the best online courses. Their courses are easy to understand and the website is user-friendly. I would definitely recommend it because the courses gives you an in-depth focus on possible careers.

That’s OK.","url":"https://alison.com/blog/sometimes-it-feels-like-youre-stuck-thats-ok","date":"Mar 1, 2021","thanks":"","content":"By Maria T. – A few years ago I met up with a friend who I hadn’t seen in two years. She had so much news to tell me. She had moved country a year before and started a new job. Then she had met a new partner, bought a house, and it looked like she is going to get a promotion. That’s the short version; it took her nearly an hour to explain all of the news in her life. And I was really happy for her, honestly. But then she asked me about my news, and I realised: I didn’t have any. In that split second, my first thought was “Is my life stuck?”. It dawned on me that in the previous two years, nothing had happened to me. I was just going to work every day to the same job, no promotion, no new partner, no exciting moves abroad or to a new city. And I can’t lie, in that moment I felt kind of down. Here was this person in front of me talking about her incredibly exciting life and I didn’t have anything similar going on in mine. And for a little while after that, I actually felt kind of depressed. It took some time before I realised that I was making a mistake. My mistake wasn’t that I didn’t have a new job, or moving country, or didn’t have a new partner. My mistake was that I thought all of that was a bad thing. By changing my thinking, I got a much better handle on my stress levels. I don’t think the question should be whether or not things in your life are changing. The question should be “do you want them to change?” And if you do want them to change, how can you change them? I became a lot more comfortable with what I previously thought was me being stuck once I asked myself these questions. You see, when I asked myself if I wanted my job to change, I realised that I was actually quite good at my job. I remembered that years ago I had worked hard to get that job, and that if I switched jobs it would actually make the rest of my life complicated in a way I did not want at the time. But I also realised that I wanted to feel like I was getting even better in my job, so I enrolled in a new business course to upgrade my skills. That really made me feel like I was growing in my work, even if I wasn’t looking for a promotion. Then when I asked myself if I wanted my social life to change, I realised that I actually did. I wanted to meet new people and try new things. But I also realised that I did not want anything too serious, nothing too life-changing. So I asked myself how I could do this. It turns out, it’s actually really easy to start a new hobby, and through new hobbies you just naturally meet new people. Finally, I asked myself if I wanted a new partner. The answer was yes, but I also decided I wanted that to come naturally. Some things in life should just happen if they are supposed to happen, and if they don’t happen that’s fine. Some things are in our control, and some don’t have to be. I think acknowledging this is great for mental health, but that’s just my opinion. Find what works for you in your life, love what you love, change what you can, and leave the rest. It’s a really great formula, I think.","length":3057,"tokens":743,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Sometimes It Feels Like You’re Stuck.

Dreams are much easier. Lots of people think of great ideas for little or big things they want to achieve. Organising your life so that you can achieve these things is completely different. I used to be really really bad at this. I honestly lost count of how many things I started and then never finished. But recently I’ve been doing a few things little differently, and they’ve really helped. Here’s a few small pointers to get you a little more organised. 1. Start really small Being organised is a habit, not an act. The best thing you can do to start a habit is to start small, then work your way up. You don’t have to organise your whole life straight away. Instead, take a small space and organise that. Start with your desk. Think about a new way to organise your desk, and then apply that. Then do the same for your kitchen, then your morning, then your afternoon, then your week, then your career, and so on. 2. Make better goals Poorly-made goals are doomed to fail. There are so many things you can do wrong when you make your goals. Have you really thought about why you want to achieve this target? Have you asked yourself how much time this is going to take? Is this a goal you can divide into little pieces? If you don’t ask better questions when you make your targets, organising them will be tough. 3. Plan things, but leave yourself some space A big part of organisation is planning. There are two big things people do wrong when they are planning things: planning too little, and planning too much. If you plan too little, then you will find your time impossible to manage in the future. But if you plan too much, the same thing will happen! You always have to leave some blank space in your schedule, because in the end, something you did not expect will demand your time. If you have that bit of wiggle room in your schedule, dealing with the unknown and staying organised will be much easier. 4. Communicate your needs One of the biggest enemies for your organisation is other people trying to change your schedule. Sometimes you can’t do anything about this. But there are ways to make this happen less often. Communication skills are essential here. By communicating effectively, you can politely make sure the important people know what you are doing, and what you can do. This can really help prevent people from messing up your schedule later on. 5. Keep your motivation up Staying organised requires staying motivated. Life will try to find a thousand ways to interrupt the organisation you’ve put together. This can be stressful and demotivating. But there are a lot of ways to keep up your motivation and to destress. Put some research into them, it only takes a few minutes and can be really great for your state of mind and how organised you can become!","length":2838,"tokens":608,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"How To Become A Little More Organised","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/how-to-become-a-little-more-organised","essay_date":"Mar 1, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"By Francisco P. – Organisation can be so difficult.

[email protected] uses Alison’s free online learning to help empower the young people they’re helping set out on the road to employment. “We have been collaborating with Alison for almost two years now and have had many of our youth complete a number of the courses on the Alison platform,” says Director Erica Kempken. “Since September 2020, we have youth registering for the courses through the portal on our website. We have noticed the value of the courses to our youth and would like to strengthen our work with Alison and promote the courses more widely.” [email protected] avail of Alison Groups, a tool which allows them to monitor the progress of their students by seeing what courses they are taking and the grades they are achieving. “The Groups functionality works well,” says Erica. “We use it as a tracking tool. The capability of seeing how far an individual has progressed is useful and allows us to engage with the youth to explore why they are not progressing further.” [email protected] have provided over 1200 young people with placements this year and foresee huge growth in the immediate future as the covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the crisis in South African education, as well as exacerbating the challenge many young South Africans face in gaining employment. However despite the pandemic conditions, [email protected] have had countless success stories in the last twelve months, including Sabelo Ngcobo and Molemo Mashigo. Sabelo Ngcobo is from the province of KwaZulu-Natal, south of Durban. After matriculating from high school, he studied Business Administration as well as Financial Literacy with ABSA bank. Sabelo, tell us about your experience with [email protected] “I got involved with the [email protected] programme through my previous college, where I was studying Business Administration. After finishing my studies, I received a call from them telling me about the opportunity and I was happy to take it. My experience with [email protected] was amazing. Thanks to them, I now have two years work experience. [email protected] offered me the opportunity to be part of their programme and, through the programme, I was placed at a school as a teacher’s assistant for one year. After that year, I was offered a School Governing Body post for six months. (The School Governing Body is a committee elected by parents to represent them and to make sure that the school operates efficiently.) I also got the opportunity to be part of the presidential programme. (The presidential programme is an initiative by the President of South Africa to reduce unemployment.) How did you find using Alison? [email protected] introduced me to lots of other helpful platforms to help me further my studies, like Alison. I enjoy studying through Alison and I have gained the following qualifications: Dealing With Difficult People In Life & Work, Diploma in Supply Chain Management, Merchandising and Data Capturing. Alison courses have helped me a lot in my career. I am now able to apply for different jobs and I also learned a lot from their courses that assisted me in growing my gardening business. Where are you working now? I am currently working for Mbalasi Primary School and I also have my own gardening services company and currently employ three people. My hope is that, in the future, I will be one of the most successful business people in KwaZulu-Natal. Molemo Mashigois a football player, coach, photographer and graphic designer from Gauteng Province. Molemo, how did you get involved with [email protected]? “My [email protected] journey began in January 2020 with a workshop aimed at teaching us how to conduct ourselves as professional coaches. Coaches have a duty that is often overlooked by society. It’s considered unimportant that we coach children for a few hours each week but we play an important part in the children’s lives. We instill morals and values and build social skills. How we carry ourselves in our roles is important and this was highlighted during the course. A few weeks later I was fully introduced to Erica and the [email protected] team.” How has [email protected] affected you? [email protected] has greatly impacted me and it’s been a fun journey of discovery through the modules that [email protected] encouraged me to take. I could see the difference in myself as I was doing things with more purpose. I wasn’t just waking up, showing up for work and leaving but instead understanding the dynamics of a community and how everyone is important. Tell us about your experience of studying with Alison. What courses have you taken? It was challenging in the beginning as, with self-study, there is no one there to baby you to study and complete courses. I was curious about Photography, Graphic Design and Social Media. The coronavirus course was also insightful and informative. The global pandemic has affected so many healthcare systems and economies and so much is rapidly changing. Alison courses encourage students to experiment and read more on the topics and to put theory into practice. I found using Alison Groups helpful during assessments. If we didn’t get it right the first time around, we could keep trying and guide each other. How have Alison courses helped you in your career? So what am I doing with the knowledge I’ve gained? Well, I started Clueless – a sports show on Instagram appreciating women in sports. There are so many clueless people when it comes to women in sports, so I interview athletes and share their stories and break the stigma that women can’t be professional athletes. My show developed into Clueless Media – photography, videography and content creation for both events and products. I approach small and medium sized enterprises and offer to create a package that will assist them by giving them a professional look with custom logos and also marketing strategies to increase sales. This has all been made possible through pointers from Alison modules. I’ve brought it all together to improve my life. And not just for me, but for my parents, who are both well over sixty. The work enables me to provide medication, food and other essentials. It’s fulfilling because they have taken care of me all these years. Now its my turn to look after them.

My show developed into Clueless Media – photography, videography and content creation for both events and products. I approach small and medium sized enterprises and offer to create a package that will assist them by giving them a professional look with custom logos and also marketing strategies to increase sales.

Work, family and social obligations, and rest & recuperation all come before dedicating time to personal development, and so it can sometimes feel like you’ll never get the opportunity to learn anything new or broaden your horizons. However there are certain pastimes you can take up which are not just a great way to relax and enjoy yourself, but are clinically proven to make you smarter! We’ve put together a list of 8 hobbies that won’t just make you feel good, they’ll make you feel smarter! 1. Photography In photography, you combine different elements like light, exposure, and effects to click a perfect picture, which requires a lot of focus and concentration. This boosts your brain activity and helps you solve puzzles easily. 2. Gardening When gardening, you get in contact with a soil bacteria that triggers the release of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a happy chemical that makes you feel cheerful and boosts your learning skills. 3. Learning Music A 2007 study by Stanford University found that our brains naturally look for patterns to follow to overcome chaos, and music helps us do this. Listening to and playing music makes you smarter, happier, healthier and productive. 4. Reading Literature We know reading books is good for the brain. But by “deep reading” (like reading novels, poems and other literature works), you take your brain activity to the next level by gaining intellectual and emotional stability. 5. Language Learning Speaking multiple languages improves your leadership, planning and problem-solving skills. You analyse new grammar structures and learn new words which enhances your creativity and intelligence. 6. Exercising Regularly Have you heard of the protein called BDNF? It helps with boosting memory, learning, concentration, and understanding. And when you exercise regularly, your cells are flooded with BDNF! 7. Quizzes Quizzes don’t just improve your brain activity but also helps in getting to know yourself. From memory games, personality or language tests, to subject-focused quizzes like Math or Science, there are numerous online quizzes available, and something for everyone. 8. Meditation In 1992, the neuroscientist Richard Davidson did a study on the Dalai Lama and other monks. He found that the brain waves of monks (who’d spent 34,000 hours meditating) were in a deeply compassionate state of mind and they could control their brain activity.

The award recognises Alison’s not-for-profit initiative which has succeeded in making accurate and life-saving information about the virus available to as many people around the globe as possible. In order to achieve the ambitious goal of making this vital information accessible to absolutely everyone, Alison coordinated a global translation project by calling on the goodwill and talent of our community of Learners worldwide. Thousands of Learners from every corner of the world responded to the call for translators and volunteered their time to translate the course. To date, the course has been translated into over 70 languages, including more than 20 European languages. (The full list of languages in which Coronavirus: What You Need To Know is available can be found here.) Alison Emery, who coordinated the project, was blown away by the enthusiasm, the dedication and the sheer volume of the volunteers. “In times of crisis, it is heartwarming to see and feel the solidarity and effort of people willing to give their time and eagerness to help a cause,” said Alison. “I was amazed at everyone’s contribution and zeal towards this common goal.” The Civil Solidarity Prize also acknowledges Alison’s Hall of Fame, an initiative launched in September 2020 to celebrate, honour and thank the volunteers who took part in the project.

M. Waqas Imam – ISO 45001 is an internationally agreed standard for occupational health and safety management systems published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in March 2018. Alison now features a course which will teach you everything you need to know about this essential international standard in a clear and simple manner. But why take this course? What is so essential about this standard? What is ISO 45001? Before we discuss why you should take the ISO 45001 course, let’s understand the background of the ISO 45001:2018 standard itself. While announcing the publication of this standard, ISO quoted some important statistics from International Labor Organization regarding workplace health and safety. These numbers reflect poor conditions of workplace health and safety worldwide. ILO estimated workplace damages in 2017 as including: 2.78 million fatal accidents occur at work Nearly 7700 persons dying every day because of diseases or injuries at the workplace 374 million non-fatal work-related injuries and illnesses occurring every year What needs to be done? Alleviating these problems is the core objective of the ISO 45001, and by taking this course, you can play your part in ensuring workplace health and safety in three core areas: Moral Legal Financial Morally, when an employee comes to work in a company or any industry with good health, then it’s the employee’s right to go home in the same state of health. It is a moral obligation of the company to ensure the safety and health of its workers. Legally, a worker has the right to pursue a lawsuit against an employer who they think is responsible for damaging their health or for causing a disability. Similarly, friends and relatives of that worker can file a lawsuit in the case of a death resulting from a workplace accident. Organizations then have to face legal issues that can bring huge damage to a company’s reputation. Financially, employers must compensate employees for any health and safety damages. Moreover, insurance premiums also increase in the case of frequent accidents. Therefore, financially, organizations must take health and safety very seriously. The Importance of the ISO 45001 standard and Trained Professionals In light of all of these concerns, most organizations now require people who are well trained in health and safety management at workplace. The latest ISO 45001:2018 standard for the management of health and safety is now seen as necessary by several organizations’ top management. Companies now need both implementers of ISO 45001, as well as internal auditors and people in supporting roles for the implementation of ISO 45001. By taking the ISO 45001 course, you can gain this training, ensure that your organization prevents these problems from arising, and provide for the health and safety of all its employees along the way. Therefore professionals often receive training on ISO 45001:2018 from a variety of courses, including: ISO 45001:2018 – Lead Auditor Course ISO 45001:2018 – Internal Auditor Course ISO 45001:2018 – Implementer Course ISO 45001:2018 – Awareness Course The great news is: you can learn everything you need to know, for free and in one place, in the comprehensive online course on ISO 45001:2018 at Alison. This course covers and teaches all the clauses of the standard, and contains several activities, quizzes, and an MCQ-based exam.

These are standard ways of assigning costs and responsibilities between buyers and sellers around the globe. Knowledge of Incoterms is essential for maintaining supply chains and procurement processes. The free online course Fundamentals of Incoterms is designed to provide any professional working in these areas with a clear, and comprehensive overview of these essential frameworks. This is vital training. The Importance of Incoterms Proposed by the International Chamber of Commerce, Incoterms offer a framework for dealing with sales contracts issues, including: arranging and paying for transportation; customs clearance; duty and VAT payments; arranging necessary documentation; and agreeing on the point where risk and insurance responsibility is passed over from the seller to the buyer. One of the most significant roles of Incoterms is ensuring that all international trade is performed in a standardized, best practice manner. Buyers and sellers who do not use Incoterms regularly suffer from extra costs, risks, and re-negotiations caused by the continuous need to consider variations in language and shipping practices. Luckily, Incoterms clarify obligations and allow shippers to maintain standard practices without having to constantly negotiate new types of agreements. How can the Fundamentals of Incoterms training course help you? Standardization of language Many believe that clear language in a contract is enough to ensure that all parties understand their obligations in international trade. Yet, it is important to note that the connotations of terms in one location may not be the same in another location. For instance, one country might define tariffs as fees imposed by the local government whereas in another country, tariffs might include taxes, fees or surcharges imposed by federal, state, and local governments. Understanding the fundamentals of Incoterms helps employees eliminate inconsistencies in language by giving all parties the same definition of specific terms within a commercial agreement. Consequently, the risk of problems during shipment is reduced, since all parties clearly understand their responsibilities under a given contract. Understanding each Incoterms variant leads to a better workflow It is essential that parties in international shipping understand how Incoterms vary. Employees need to understand the correct meaning of each type of Incoterm in order to avoid problems throughout the subsequent supply chain. Misuse of Incoterms can lead to serious complications as it can affect payment of goods and delivery schedules, and may lead to increased costs, poor inventory control, and negative customer interactions. Indeed, from distribution centers to shipping recipients, misunderstandings can dramatically disrupt the flow of goods and damage a company’s reputation. Knowledge about Incoterms affects profit and competitive advantage. Incoterms are essential for ensuring proper, timely payment for goods and services, since they define the monetary and procedural aspects of all international shipping practices. They also ensure that all parties are able to maintain a competitive advantage in the international supply chain. For example, if a governing authority were to make adjustments to local terminology, then this terminology could directly impact the competitive advantage of companies. In other words, one company may benefit from the local terminology while the other company endures limitations on capacity and shipping regulations. In contrast, the incidence of bribery and unfair business practices is reduced when Incoterms are used in international trade. This prevents potential penalties and fines in global trade. Conclusion The importance of understanding Incoterms from both a seller and a buyer’s perspective should not be underestimated. Without a clear knowledge of the features, obligations and responsibilities of each of the different options in Incoterms, traders may fail to choose the most suitable Incoterm for their transactions. However, with just a little bit of training, you can avoid this pitfall. The free Fundamentals of Incoterms course is designed to get you up to speed on this important framework in just a few short hours, so have a look at it today, and start getting up to speed.","length":4461,"tokens":812,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"White Paper: The Importance of Incoterms Training","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/white-paper-the-importance-of-incoterms-training","essay_date":"Feb 13, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"By Kishan Kanodia – Incoterms is short for “international commercial terms”, and refers to a set of internationally recognized shipping terms such as CIF, EXW, and FOB.

For instance, one country might define tariffs as fees imposed by the local government whereas in another country, tariffs might include taxes, fees or surcharges imposed by federal, state, and local governments.","content_length":1048,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"White Paper: The Importance of Incoterms Training","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/white-paper-the-importance-of-incoterms-training","essay_date":"Feb 13, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Understanding the fundamentals of Incoterms helps employees eliminate inconsistencies in language by giving all parties the same definition of specific terms within a commercial agreement. Consequently, the risk of problems during shipment is reduced, since all parties clearly understand their responsibilities under a given contract. Understanding each Incoterms variant leads to a better workflow It is essential that parties in international shipping understand how Incoterms vary. Employees need to understand the correct meaning of each type of Incoterm in order to avoid problems throughout the subsequent supply chain. Misuse of Incoterms can lead to serious complications as it can affect payment of goods and delivery schedules, and may lead to increased costs, poor inventory control, and negative customer interactions. Indeed, from distribution centers to shipping recipients, misunderstandings can dramatically disrupt the flow of goods and damage a company’s reputation. Knowledge about Incoterms affects profit and competitive advantage.","content_length":1053,"content_tokens":178,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"White Paper: The Importance of Incoterms Training","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/white-paper-the-importance-of-incoterms-training","essay_date":"Feb 13, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"Incoterms are essential for ensuring proper, timely payment for goods and services, since they define the monetary and procedural aspects of all international shipping practices. They also ensure that all parties are able to maintain a competitive advantage in the international supply chain. For example, if a governing authority were to make adjustments to local terminology, then this terminology could directly impact the competitive advantage of companies. In other words, one company may benefit from the local terminology while the other company endures limitations on capacity and shipping regulations. In contrast, the incidence of bribery and unfair business practices is reduced when Incoterms are used in international trade. This prevents potential penalties and fines in global trade. Conclusion The importance of understanding Incoterms from both a seller and a buyer’s perspective should not be underestimated. Without a clear knowledge of the features, obligations and responsibilities of each of the different options in Incoterms, traders may fail to choose the most suitable Incoterm for their transactions. However, with just a little bit of training, you can avoid this pitfall. The free Fundamentals of Incoterms course is designed to get you up to speed on this important framework in just a few short hours, so have a look at it today, and start getting up to speed.","content_length":1390,"content_tokens":256,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Konstantinos Vichoudis: “I recommend Alison because of their mission: innovation, inclusivity, knowledge, empowerment.”","url":"https://alison.com/blog/konstantinos-vichoudis-recommend-alison-mission-innovation-inclusivity-knowledge-empowerment","date":"Feb 12, 2021","thanks":"","content":"“My name is Konstantinos Vichoudis.

I’ve just recently discovered Alison and I have enrolled in 27 courses already. I also want to enroll in the Project Management Learning Path.

For example, I was asked to teach a seminar on building insulation at a vocational center and we will use Zoom there. So I started the Online Zoom Course – Beginner to Advanced.

Here are the 8 most commonly made errors to watch out for. 1. The Missing Comma A comma is used after an introductory word, phrase, or clause. This gives a pause after the introductory element and delivers the message without confusion. Example: In case you didn’t know, I’m on leave next week. 2. The Apostrophe Catastrophe Use “It’s” when the word means “It is” or “It has”. Example: I don’t believe it’s been a week! Use “Its” when something is belonging to it. Example: The pillow looks great with its new cover. 3. The Four W’s Now that’s tricky. Let’s break it down, shall we? “Who” is used to identify a living pronoun. Example: Who baked this cake? “Whom” is used to describe someone on the receiving end of an action. Example: Whom did we hire for the position? “Whose” is used to assign ownership to someone. Example: Whose jacket is this? “Who’s” is the contraction of “Who is” or “Who has”. 4. Two Dots Don’t Make a Right A colon is used after a complete sentence to introduce a word, phrase, clause, list or a quotation. It’s used to signal that what follows next will prove or explain the former statement. Example: There’s an increase in the number of people taking up online courses for three reasons: learning from the comfort of their home, increase their knowledge and skills at their own pace, boosts their résumé. 5. Fewer vs Less – What’s The Difference? They are both the opposite for “more”, but the usage is different. Use “Fewer” when the items are countable like books, cars, pens, etc. Example: There are fewer cars in the parking area. Use “Less” when the items are not countable like sand, love, time, etc. Example: This glass has less water. 6. A Lot Of “Alot” Mistakes! A lot of people use “Alot” (pun intended), but “Alot” is not a word! Yes, you heard it right. If you want to describe a vast number of things, use “A Lot”. Example: I have a lot of things to do. If you allocate or keep a certain portion for something, then you use “allot”. Example: I allot two hours a day for learning. 7. The Spelling Slip-Up They sound exactly the same, but they have very different meaning. “Compliment” is a polite expression of praise or admiration. “Complement” is something that contributes extra features or improves something. 8. The Semicolon Stumble A semicolon connects two independent clauses. The two clauses make sense on their own, but if they’re interrelated, you use a semicolon to connect them. Example: Call me tomorrow; I’ll let you know by then.","length":2583,"tokens":705,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"8 Most Common English Grammar Mistakes We Make","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/8-most-common-english-grammar-mistakes-we-make","essay_date":"Feb 12, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"When it comes to language, it’s easy to make English grammar mistakes, even as native speakers.

There’s no such thing as a perfect workplace. No matter who you are or where you work, there will be something that makes your day a little (or a lot) more difficult than you want it to be. Some of these workplace problems are things we just have to deal with, but there are some things we don’t have to accept. The question is, what are we supposed to do about them? We can’t solve every problem, but in my experience there are certain things that we can improve if we approach them in the right way. By applying a few strategies and techniques to different workplace problems, you can make your working life a little easier, improve your productivity, and ultimately just enjoy your day a little more. So, here’s a few things I’ve learned over the years, I really hope they’re helpful for you. 1. Too many demands on your time If you feel like you can’t keep track of all the things you have to do, then one of two things is happening. On the one hand, might need to gain a few more time management skills, which could make your day a little more organised. On the other, you may just need to calmly explain to your boss that there is too much on your desk. Don’t worry, your boss doesn’t want you to be overloaded. If there is too much for you to do, they will understand. 2. Bad relationship with a colleague An annoying or disruptive colleague can make your day so much more difficult than it needs to be, and really impact your productivity at the same time. Of course, if the colleague does something truly awful, you can report them, but most of the time it’s not that simple. Try learning a bit about conflict management, and using these techniques to smooth out your workplace relationships. 3. Can’t find motivation This is one of the most common problems people have at work. After a while working the same job, it’s just difficult to remain excited about it. Try remembering that almost every job becomes a bit repetitive after a while, and that losing motivation is something that can be fixed. Check out these tips for finding motivation, and re-find the energy you need to get through your day. 4. It’s just not the right job Certain workplaces can’t be fixed. Either you’re in the wrong profession, the wrong department, or just the wrong company, you may just need to think about some alternatives. Don’t worry, almost everyone has to switch jobs eventually. This is a scary process, but you can handle it.

A great designer can make the difference between an attractive website that draws in customers and an ugly one that pushes them away. With a few effective design techniques, you can bring a city centre to life, create a compelling logo, or just decorate your house with a little bit more flair. While some people are naturally gifted designers, I really believe there is a little design guru in all of us that can be helped along with a small amount of time and training. So, I spoke to some friends of mine who work in design for a living, and asked them for the best tips they have for improving your design techniques. I’ve put together some common answers here, hopefully they’re of use to you. It doesn’t matter whether you’re thinking of starting a career as a designer or if you just have a little urge to mess around with some colours, shapes, and arrangements. These tips could give you what you need to start designing something really beautiful today. 1. Look for inspiration The most common problem beginner designers face is actually a really difficult one: “What should I make?!” Great ideas don’t just come to everybody naturally. The good news is, they don’t have to! You can find inspiration and great design ideas in the works of artists everywhere. Explore what already exists and use that as a source of ideas that you can adapt and make your own. 2. Stay up to date with helpful software You don’t need to rely on your own sketching ability or the power of your mind’s eye. There is some really helpful software out there that can add some great design techniques to your tool belt. The most important place to start is Adobe Photoshop. Once you’ve mastered this tool, you will have the skills you need to really improve your designs and sketches. 3. Remember, design isn’t magic. It’s rules and practice. Don’t think that some people are “just good at design”. Design techniques are not magic, there are rules that every good designer learns and sticks to. These principles of design can be learned in a short space of time. Once you have them, you will see your designs start looking a lot more professional and attractive. But only as long as you keep practicing! 4. Start understanding colours If there is one set of design rules that you absolutely must learn immediately, it’s colour theory. With a strong understanding of how colours interact and complement each other, you can improve your designs in almost any setting. From selecting the best colours for your wall to choosing your next outfit. This is a great little piece of knowledge that you can apply to pretty much anything!

How Can You Get There?","url":"https://alison.com/blog/where-are-you-going-how-can-you-get-there","date":"Feb 7, 2021","thanks":"","content":"By Maria T. Do you know where you are going in life? A lot of people don’t. If you have a clear idea of where you want to be in a few years, you really are a lucky one. Dreams are valuable, if you’ve got one then hold onto it! But even more important than dreams, are plans. If you know where you are going, do you know how to get there? With a plan, you can turn a dream into an action, a fantasy into a set of real, concrete steps. The problem is, not many of us have solid answers to these two questions. Figuring out where you want to go and how to get there can seem very difficult, sometimes impossible. The world is so big, there are so many opportunities, and so many obstacles. How can we figure all of this out?! Don’t worry. When you think about things in terms of smaller, more bitesize questions, life becomes a lot easier to manage. Here are 4 simple things to think about, and do, in order to get some life direction. 1. What is important to you in life and work? Ask yourself this question, and don’t think too hard. Just focus on what comes naturally to you. Is it family? Working directly with people? Maybe getting a promotion and becoming a manager, or starting your own business? Perhaps what you really value in life is travel, or just being healthy? Whatever it is, be honest, write it down, and focus on that thing. Your answers to this question will provide you with some insights into how you want your life to progress. 2. What do you (not) like about your current job?

Do you know where you are going in life? A lot of people don’t. If you have a clear idea of where you want to be in a few years, you really are a lucky one. Dreams are valuable, if you’ve got one then hold onto it! But even more important than dreams, are plans. If you know where you are going, do you know how to get there? With a plan, you can turn a dream into an action, a fantasy into a set of real, concrete steps. The problem is, not many of us have solid answers to these two questions. Figuring out where you want to go and how to get there can seem very difficult, sometimes impossible. The world is so big, there are so many opportunities, and so many obstacles.

Just focus on what comes naturally to you. Is it family? Working directly with people? Maybe getting a promotion and becoming a manager, or starting your own business? Perhaps what you really value in life is travel, or just being healthy? Whatever it is, be honest, write it down, and focus on that thing.

Try These Helpful Techniques","url":"https://alison.com/blog/want-to-gain-confidence-try-these-helpful-techniques","date":"Feb 6, 2021","thanks":"","content":"By Sarah K. One way to make a big difference to your life is to gain confidence. From negotiating your salary, to standing up for yourself, to believing you can make your dreams a reality, confidence is often the most important ingredient. But confidence doesn’t come naturally to most of us. For the majority of people, those big moments where you have to believe in yourself usually result in self-doubt and a little anxiety. This is normal. The good news is that confidence isn’t just a magic quality that some people have and some people don’t. Confidence can be developed, it just takes a few tricks and some practice. It might seem impossible at the start, but if you keep a few things in mind then you really can gain confidence with time. Here’s a few simple tips to get you started. 1. Take care of yourself One of the best ways you can begin to value yourself and see your own importance more is to start taking care of yourself a little more. Take some time to make sure you are eating a little better or giving your body the exercise it needs. Over time, you will begin to see the improvements you have made to your health and the importance of valuing yourself. 2. Give someone some help It could be something small, with a neighbour, a friend, a colleague, or a complete stranger. Most of us have a family member who could do with a little assistance in their lives, especially the elderly who need caregiving sometimes. By making a difference in someone else’s life you will see just how impactful you can be, which can be a great way to gain confidence. 3. That voice is not right We all have voices in our head that tell us things we shouldn’t listen to. Those voices can trick us into doing silly things, but did you know there are some great psychological techniques for ignoring or controlling those voices? The next time you hear the voice that tells you that you can’t do something, or don’t deserve something, just remember “It’s just a voice, that doesn’t make it accurate.” 4. It’s not about what you can do right now If someone asks you to do something that you can’t do, don’t lose confidence. The only important thing that is that you can find the motivation to learn how to do this thing, or that you can tell the person this is just not possible. Having confidence is not just about who you are right now. It’s definitely not about who you used to be. It’s about who you are going to become. So, keep these few tips in mind, gain confidence little by little each day, and keep moving forward. This can make a real difference to your life and work, so give it a go.

Life doesn’t always go smoothly. There are ups and downs, backward steps, and sometimes no movement at all. Every now and then, something happens that really throws you, something that makes it kind of hard to concentrate or start moving on with your life. And even if nothing terribly bad has come your way, sometimes it just feels like not many positive things have happened for you lately, or even for a while. Whatever the reason, sometimes everyone wants to get some sense of forward movement. The good news is, there are simple things you can do to make this happen. Not everything in life is in our control, but some things are. Here’s three simple actions that can make a positive difference, and allow you to start moving forward. 1. Join A Social Group Interacting with new people who share a hobby with you is a great way to invite some change into your life. Whether you’re interested in football, art, board games, reading, even just online gaming, there is probably someone in your town who shares that interest. And if there isn’t, there are countless online forums where you can discuss your interests and discover people who share them with you. Start or join a group in your local area or online, and see where it leads. 2. Start A Fitness Routine People who don’t have a fitness routine often think that exercise is just about getting in shape. While of course exercise is great for your health, putting together a fitness routine is about more than that. A daily or even just twice weekly routine can activate you in a way that makes the rest of your day and week a lot easier. A good routine should leave you feeling ready for your day, more capable, more productive, and more energised. This can really help get you out a slump and start moving forward in your life. 3. Set Great Goals It doesn’t particularly matter what your goals are, so long as they are meaningful to you. Setting goals gives you something to work towards, a sense of achievement, a feeling of control, and can help you organise your week and make worthwhile career plans. Sometimes it can be difficult to set the right goals, so check out this advice on how to choose the best goals for you. By taking one or more of these steps, you can start moving forward and enter a new routine. This can be a great little boost for anyone feeling like life hasn’t been going so positively lately, or who just wants to make a change.

Whether it’s at work or in your home, there is probably a desk in your life somewhere. Most people never even think about the way they arrange and treat their desk. But these little subconscious habits of ours are actually really revealing. How you organise your desk can say a lot about you, what you enjoy, what you don’t, and what you care about. Take a look at your desk. What do you see? Photos of family? A plant? A pile of papers? Nothing at all? How are these things arranged? And what does it all mean?! Without getting too psychological, here’s a couple of desk styles and what they say about you (or the people around you!) 1. A total mess Papers are everywhere. Notes are scribbled on top of other notes. Pens are located more by feel than by sight. The drawers are overflowing. Maybe you know where everything is (most of the time) but anyone who dares to look at your desk would struggle to spot your file storage system. This might not bother you at all, but every now and then you may feel the urge to become a little more organised. In the meantime, don’t lose your stuff in all that clutter! 2. Everything in straight lines Not a single pen is out of place, almost everything is stored in neatly arranged filing boxes, and everything on the desk is parallel to everything else. You are as tidy and organised as possible. While this can be a great thing, it can also be a source of stress. If you feel a little anxious sometimes, relax, maybe try a little yoga, and remember that sometimes it’s just not worth focusing on small stuff so much. 3. A blank space Looking at your desk, you see…nothing. No flowers, no old notes, no filing boxes or pen holders. And why should you? All you really need is your screen and maybe a pen and paper. You’re the kind of person who gets straight to the point and doesn’t mess around. You’re always maximising efficiency, and you enjoy knowing how to prioritise your time so you can focus more on the important stuff, like actually working. 4. Memories everywhere Here’s a photo of your first cat. There’s a shell you found on a beach in Mexico. Here’s a trophy from a sports day you competed in when you were six. Your desk is a little collection of all your best memories and you can’t wait to collect some more. You’ve got a visual, creative spirit and imagination, and you’ve probably got a hidden talent for photography. Keep filling up your space with great memories, just make sure you leave some space on your desk for doing some work.

Did you know that computer programming is predicted to be the most in-demand career of the next decade? Almost every major task a company must complete, from file management and advertising to customer engagement and data analysis, now relies on computers. As companies everywhere become dependent on computer technology, they are becoming dependent on computer programmers. This means that if you can become one of those skilled computer programmers, you will be securing a solid career. But how do you make your computer programming résumé look really impressive? It turns out, there are a few basic skills that computer programmers everywhere need. Here’s the top 5. Check them out, and start gaining the right skills for your future career! 1. Javascript Javascript is central to every website’s functionality. Any interactive webpage requires the language, and every major web browser is enabled to execute it. If you’re looking for a boost to your computer programming skill set, you can’t go wrong with learning Javascript. Particularly for those who want to work on a company’s website in the future, this will be the key to success. 2. Python Python is a fast growing language with some very worthwhile uses. For starters, this is a highly readable and effective language used in data analysis. Consequently, companies with large and complex data sets looking to improve their customer engagement really value computer programmers with Python. Check out Python and see if this is the next skill you need! 3. C++ Learning C++ is a must if you are just getting started with computer programming. C++ is the core operating language of several major systems, games, and browsers. Moreover, learning C++ can be the gateway towards learning several more niche and specialised languages. It’s also a highly scalable language predicted to be very important for several years to come, so it’s a great one for expanding your future career. 4. C# From building Microsoft applications to developing profitable games, C# is a fundamental language for computer programmers worldwide. If you ever want to work on the ASP. NET framework (one of the core frameworks for the world’s largest companies) C# is going to be the tool for you. This is a slightly more complex language, so get the aid of some simple training to get it onto your résumé quickly and easily. 5. Math That’s right, Math. Computer programmers spend large amounts of time working on algorithms, solving problems, and constructing multi-level systems. This requires logical, numerical thinking. A strong understanding of mathematical principles is therefore very helpful for computer programmers. This means that brushing up on your Math skills can give your computer programming career a real boost. A career as a computer programmer is not just profitable and respected, it’s also exciting, fun, and opens doors worldwide.

Satisfying jobs are a combination of all three! We’ve rounded up a list of the Top 10 most satisfying jobs to inspire you towards career fulfillment. 1. Teacher – Changing young lives for the better A rewarding, demanding and consistently popular career path – Teaching is not just a career, but a calling! From imparting wisdom into young minds, to influencing students in shaping their future, the role of a teacher is irreplaceable. 2. Nurse – The heartbeat of healthcare! Having a career that will give you a stable financial future is crucial, but it’s also important to have a career that is personally rewarding. Being a nurse gives you the best of all worlds – personal fulfillment, job security, and flexibility. 3. Human Resources Manager – Leading people, leading organisations Other than being involved in recruitment, company laws, and other hiring processes, HR Managers also handle workplace issues, conflicts, salary benefits and more. They directly help employees with their issues and work towards resolving problems, which brings great job satisfaction to this role. 4. Physical Therapist – Enriching the lives of people! Physical Therapists deal with patients who are injured and journey with them on their road to becoming physically independent. They can choose a variety of work environments, like sports centres, gyms, or hospitals, making this job role not only fulfilling, but very dynamic. 5. Artist – Creativity begins with you! According to a study published by the Journal of Cultural Economics, Artists have higher job satisfaction compared to any other profession! Being an Artist means you follow your passion. When your passion becomes your profession, it’s not work anymore. 6.

It’s simple: carpentry is an amazing skill. A few years ago I was sitting at my desk, doing some work, when suddenly the desk just collapsed in front of me. Everything – my laptop, my books, my papers, my coffee, everything – just went all over the place. I was shocked. I picked up my things, threw out my ruined papers, and started looking for a new desk online. That evening I told me brother what had happened. He asked to see the desk. “Why are you buying a new desk?” he asked. “Because this one is completely broken!” I replied. He explained to me that the only part of the desk that was broken was the joint between one leg and the top of the desk, and I could fix that easily myself instead of spending money on a new desk. And that’s how my adventure with carpentry began. I’ve loved it ever since. Here’s why: 1. You can easily build almost anything In the past few years, I’ve discovered that with a few basic carpentry skills you can build almost anything. I used to think that you had to be a professional carpenter to build a shelf or a desk, but it turns out that you only need a few skills and some wood to build anything from a chair to cabinet. My house is now full of things that I’ve built myself, and that’s a real source of pride. 2. Carpentry will save you so much money When something breaks, or my house needs something new, my first instinct used to be “call someone else and pay them to fix it or make it.” I don’t want to think about how much money I wasted doing that, not realising that I could have done it all myself. After a couple of carpentry lessons, I was able to fix my desk, my creaking doors, my wobbly chairs, even install a window frame. After I bought the initial equipment, my house maintenance costs have gone way down. 3. There is so much to learn Learning carpentry is like learning an instrument: you will never be done. Just like you can never learn all the songs, you can never finish discovering new and interesting carpentry techniques. This makes carpentry a real hobby for life, full of little lessons and big ones, so you can learn at your own pace and never get bored. 4. Carpentry is a great way to destress If I’ve had a bad day at work, or a stressful day in general, my carpentry projects always put me back in a great headspace. Whether it’s making a wooden cup or a salad spoon or just a funny looking object to put on the shelf, I always know that I can come home, do a little bit of carpentry, and calm down. This is one of my favourite stress management techniques. These are just a few reasons to start learning carpentry, there are many more. But don’t take my word for it, try a free online short carpentry course yourself and see if you like it. You never know, it could be the start of a great lifelong hobby.","length":2793,"tokens":670,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"4 Reasons I’m Delighted I Learned Carpentry","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/4-reasons-im-delighted-i-learned-carpentry","essay_date":"Feb 1, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"By Philip S.

Devoting too much attention to your own work, without taking into account the surrounding workings of the business, can have a significant negative affect on your workplace. As you become more experienced in your work, it’s important to also retain perspective of how you fit into the workplace at large. Here are five good reasons why it’s so important to develop knowledge outside of your own speciality: By learning how the different departments in your place of work function, you can understand how your work is impacting other parts of the business. This allows you to cultivate practices that might make a small difference to your working life but might lead to a huge rise in productivity elsewhere. It can be highly valuable to get fresh ideas from work sectors entirely different from your own, as there are often tasks or systems, such as time management, which are common to all sectors. By taking the opportunity to observe a different field, you might learn new ways of working in your own area.

And for every Alison graduate in employment, there’s an employer who has recognised the quality education that Alison provides to all its Learners. This week, three employers from Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa tell us about their experience of hiring Alison graduates. Huw Simpson is an independent software developer from South Africa. Although he usually works alone, Huw sometimes works with freelancers when he has work that he feels comfortable entrusting to someone else. In December 2019, Huw’s good friend, John Taylor, who had worked as a motor mechanic for over twenty years, was made redundant. John was faced with the challenge of reskilling after having spent over half his life working as a mechanic. Then Huw and Alison stepped in. “John and I were already friends”, says Huw. “He is technically minded, and I felt I could do with a junior developer that I could trust, so I approached him and suggested that he learn to programme. He had always wanted to learn but never got the opportunity! I started searching for appropriate courses for John on the internet and Alison came up.” John began taking Alison courses in programming, starting with Introduction to Software Testing. He then moved on to more advanced courses, like the Diploma in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and hasn’t looked back. John has now begun a successful new career and Huw has a skilled developer he can rely on. “John progressed quite rapidly through Alison and has retained much of his training.” While Huw’s operation is still quite small, he says that if it grows, then he’d be on the lookout for more Alison Graduates with programming skills. Read the full story of how John found a new career path with the help of Alison here. Ifeanyi Ukandu is the HR Manager of Rockgarden Homes & Homecare Agency in Ikorodu, Lagos State, Nigeria. Rockgarden offers high quality live-in and at-home elderly care. Ifeanyi has a degree in Business Administration from Ekiti State University and a master’s in Business Administration from the University of Sunderland, as well as postgraduate diplomas in Management Studies and Strategic Management and Leadership. Ifeanyi brings over a decade of experience in Human Resources and Personnel Management to his role at Rockgarden Homes. One of the team members who reports to Ifeanyi is Alison Graduate Oladapo Onasanya, from Ogun State. Oladapo has a degree in Mathematical Sciences, as well as a variety of certificates from Alison, including Business Management, Operations Management, Sales Management and Project Management. Oladapo is currently Rockgarden’s Business Development Manager. “I have taken several courses on Alison and I still have other courses pending”, says Oladapo. “I take courses on Alison when I have to change jobs or when I have to complete a business project and need to update my knowledge and acquire skills to be able to do it properly.” When Ifeanyi sees on someone’s CV that they’re an Alison Graduate, he knows that they’ll “be able to carry out their tasks in line with the best industrial practices.” He’s also keen to hire more Alison Graduates, as long as they can pass the necessary practical tests that Rockgarden give prospective employees. “We have a handful of Alison Graduates and they seem well-informed theoretically.” Ifeanyi is also “definitely” considering introducing Alison courses as part of the standard inhouse training for Rockgarden employees: “I’m hoping to go through Alison’s courses to see which ones might be suitable both for our caregivers and our management staff. Courses like Effective Leadership, Team Building and Conflict Handling.” Oladapo, who alongside his work at Rockgarden is studying Alison’s Diploma in Web Business Development and Marketing, would recommend Alison because of the concrete effect it’s had on his career: “I got a job thanks to one of my Alison certificates. Alison has high quality content. You feel fulfilled at the completion of the course and you will add value to any organization.” Read Oladapo’s success story in full here.

Sarah has been practising and teaching Craftivism – the use of crafts as activism – for over a decade and has now published a Craftivist course with Alison to share her expertise for free with learners all around the world. Sarah spoke to the Alison Blog about how she became a Craftivist, her experience of publishing with Alison and the hopes she has for her first Alison course. Hi Sarah, tell us a little bit about yourself! My name is Sarah Corbett and I run the social enterprise Craftivist Collective. My background is in activism. I grew up in a low income area of the UK and campaigned as a young person with my family and community on local, national and global issues. I ended up working for big charities as a campaigner and activism manager, most recently with Oxfam GB. Now I do craftivism using my unique “Gentle Protest” methods full time through workshops, events, consultancy, teaching and free resources as well as books, kits and tools people can buy. How did you become an expert in your field? As a young person and at university, I was always involved in activism on local and national levels, as well as campaigning on global issues like apartheid in South Africa. When I became a professional campaigner, I noticed that a lot of traditional activism was very reactive and quite black and white in its delivery (i. e. ‘You are wrong, we are right’). I felt like we needed a variety of different tools in the activism toolkit and a gentler approach to interacting with power-holders so they could really hear what solutions were needed to tackle injustice. We need to know when to ask questions, rather than demand answers, when to be quiet as well as when to speak up, and to figure out how to really channel the anger and sadness we have about injustice into strategic, thoughtful and loving activism that is effective. At this time of doubting the effectiveness of activism, I started doing handicrafts, mostly sewing, cross-stitch and hand embroidery. I noticed that it calmed me down and helped me think more clearly about how to be an effective campaigner and I thought that this could be a really useful tool to add to the activism toolkit. Quite organically, I noticed that craft for activism could be really effective in lots of different ways to help campaign for social change. Had you come across Alison before becoming a Publisher? I came across Alison through the Ashoka Fellowship that I’m a Fellow of alongside the founder of Alison, who I just think is a brilliant human being. I heard his story at an event that we were both giving talks at and so I looked into what Alison was about. I just found it so inspiring the way Alison works in such an ethical, accessible and empowering way around the world. I felt really inspired by Alison and I thought that it really fitted my work and the audience I want to reach. Why did you choose to publish with Alison? I published a book called How to Be a Craftivist – The Art of Gentle Protest, which has sold thousands of copies around the world and received great feedback from readers, but I noticed that a lot of people wanted more support. After finding out about Alison, I thought an online course could really compliment the book. It felt like another tool in my craftivism toolbox that would really help build the movement and provide existing and new craftivists with the support that they needed to do effective “Gentle Protest” through craft. Tell us a bit about the course you’re publishing. My course is called an Introduction to Gentle Craftivism and it’s a consolidation of twelve years experience of how to effectively change hearts, minds, policies and laws around the world. It features lots of examples of how craftivism has helped people personally, as makers, and also how it’s helped engage power-holders like politicians and other people of influence to create real positive change. It teaches how to use craftivism in the public sphere as a catalyst for both conversation and action. It’s a really good introduction of how to use craft as a tool for “Gentle Protest”. How did you find the experience of publishing with Alison? I’m a perfectionist so I was a bit concerned that the Alison staff might be a bit annoyed with all of my questions. But the whole process was a really joyful one for me. I’ve got twelve years of craftivist experience so it was lovely to be able to gather all of that theory and practice and formulate it into a course that’s accessible to people all over the world. I wanted to make sure the course was as universal and timeless as possible, so it can be used in different contexts and different times for years to come. It was so helpful to have the Alison staff to really challenge me, to say ‘that doesn’t quite make sense’ or ‘can we make that a bit clearer?’ Lots of the time I wanted to squeeze in too much information, so it was really good to be able to get their regular feedback on simplifying the course so that it didn’t overwhelm people. By challenging each other we were able to make the best course possible. I really enjoyed the process and hope the staff did too. What is the benefit of working with Alison? For me, there are loads of benefits. The first one is that I want to reach a global audience, perhaps people who might not naturally come across my work and Alison is an amazing platform for that. It also provides great feedback for me to learn what people find helpful and what other support I may need to offer. Also, I run the Craftivist Collective as a social enterprise and, as activism is often unpaid, it’s hugely helpful to have this passive income stream to help me to keep my “Gentle Protest” craftivism sustainable. Also, the fact that it’s a free course, and that people can choose to pay for the certificate, is really important for me because I want my work to be accessible to people, regardless of their income limitations. So there were lots of benefits. It just felt like a really good alignment between two organisations that are trying to help make the world a better place and also work in a financially sustainable way. What advice do you have for prospective publishers on Alison? My advice is to make lots of time to do the course really well. I wanted to make sure that my course was as perfect and as helpful as possible. I want it to still be useful in ten years. So I really did make time to do it well and didn’t just try to squeeze it in at the end of a Friday each week. The other advice I’d give is just be really honest with the Alison staff. I said from the beginning that I wanted them to be brutally honest with me and to tell me if something wasn’t good enough or could written better. Have that mutual respect so you can really challenge each other to create a great course everyone is proud of creating. What advice do you have for Alison’s learners? For students of my own course, my hope is that they benefit from it personally and politically. Whether they end up joining some of my craftivism campaigns or whether they use elements of the course in their own “Gentle Protests”, I just hope it’s something they enjoy doing and that it’s useful to them. For students using Alison generally, my advice is, whether you’re doing my course or another course, you’ll probably end up with more questions than answers. There are so many more amazing courses on Alison so do see what other courses are out there to help you on your journey. Use the site as much as possible. Why is free education so important? Because education is power. The more knowledge we have, the more effective we can be as global citizens, as well as become better friends, family members and colleagues. To be able to access these resources online is vital if we want our world to be healthy, happy and harmonious for all. How does free learning tie into your own project? I try to make as much of my work as free as possible to people all over the world, while doing it in a sustainable way. Having resources available online for people to use for free, regardless of where you live or your income, is an incredible way to galvanise people to create a global “Gentle Protest” community and to help people on their journey as effective positive changemakers. So much of my work is about trying to contribute to society so it should be free where possible. If you could learn anything at all from an Alison course, what would it be? I’m fascinated by Neuroscience and Behavioural Psychology. I’m always reading lots of books on those topics because they influence my work and I’m just fascinated by human beings! So any excuse to do some courses in those fields would be a joy!

Hi Sarah, tell us a little bit about yourself! My name is Sarah Corbett and I run the social enterprise Craftivist Collective. My background is in activism. I grew up in a low income area of the UK and campaigned as a young person with my family and community on local, national and global issues.

When I became a professional campaigner, I noticed that a lot of traditional activism was very reactive and quite black and white in its delivery (i. e. ‘You are wrong, we are right’) I felt like we needed a variety of different tools in the activism toolkit and a gentler approach to interacting with power-holders so they could really hear what solutions were needed to tackle injustice.","content_length":794,"content_tokens":166,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Meet Sarah Corbett – Founder of the Craftivist Collective and Alison’s Newest Publisher","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/meet-sarah-corbett-founder-craftivist-collective-alisons-newest-publisher","essay_date":"Jan 21, 2021","essay_thanks":"","content":"We need to know when to ask questions, rather than demand answers, when to be quiet as well as when to speak up, and to figure out how to really channel the anger and sadness we have about injustice into strategic, thoughtful and loving activism that is effective.

I noticed that it calmed me down and helped me think more clearly about how to be an effective campaigner and I thought that this could be a really useful tool to add to the activism toolkit.

These skills are fundamental to all workplaces and are an asset in any industry. However, sometimes we can overlook this valuable skillset. It’s crucial to include your Soft Skills on your CV because these skills are often what separate good employees from great employees. Alison has a wide range of courses available to help you refine your Soft Skills and learn new ones, with certificates available on completion to prove to potential employers how Soft-Skilled you are! Here are six of the best: Communication Efficient communication is essential in any workplace. If we can’t communicate clearly then we can’t work together as a coherent workforce. Though our means of communicating are always evolving, the importance of clear communication has remained constant. Leadership Leadership is not just about taking charge of a situation, it’s about reassuring those around you that things are under control. Leadership is as much about being responsible for others as is it about directing them, and is a vital Soft Skill to include on your CV. Teamwork Unless you’re a lighthouse keeper, the chances are your work will require you to work as part of a team. Being able to cooperate and work constructively with your colleagues is a must in any profession. Emotional Intelligence Sympathy and compassion are as important in the world of work as they are in any every other sphere of life. Workplaces can be stressful environments and so it’s vital that potential employers know that you have the emotional intelligence to navigate whatever situations might arise. Critical and Quick Thinking This is a Soft Skill that can really set you apart from other employees. While expertise and experience are important in any job, the ability to think on your feet and outside the box is also a huge advantage, and can often be what gives you the edge in a job interview. Time Management Poor time management is something that no employer wants to see in an employee, as it can have an affect on the entire business.

The report paints a vivid picture of the future of work and documents the industries which are experiencing the greatest job growth and also the areas facing contraction. 2020 has been a critical year in many respects, with millions of workers around the world finding themselves out of a job or in an uncertain employment situation as a result of the pandemic. The coronavirus has caused enormous disruption in the normal rhythm of people’s working lives and drastically altered the route that many people saw their career path taking. One thing that the pandemic has not affected is the trend towards workplace automation, which is occurring even faster than predicted. The Report estimates that this will result in the loss of 85 million jobs in the next five years. Continued technological advances, coupled with the more recent need for social distancing, have meant that machines and computers are taking over more jobs. According to the WEF Report, in five years, work will be divided roughly fifty-fifty between humans and machines. However, the Report also shows that the automation revolution will create more jobs than it will displace, with 97 million new jobs entering the labour market in a variety of new areas. To help you prepare for the coming shift, Alison has put together a series of free online courses that will equip you with the skills necessary to thrive in the jobs of tomorrow. New skills According to the Future of Jobs Report, by 2025, “analytical thinking, creativity, and flexibility will be among the most sought-after skills.” Analytical Thinking – This course will teach you everything you need to know about problem-solving and thinking critically in the workplace. Creativity – Learn how to generate new concepts and build fresh ideas. Flexibility – Manage your time successfully and be ready for whatever your workday throws at you. The Report also notes that newly emerging sought-after skills this year are “self-management, active learning, resilience and stress tolerance.” Self Management – Being able to motivate yourself is critical when it comes to Self-Management. This course will instruct you on how to always guarantee you give 100% at work. Active Learning – Learn how to adopt a Growth Mindset and apply it to your learning. Resilience – Positive Psychology is crucial if you’re to stay above water during stressful and trying situations. Stress Tolerance – This diploma teaches you coping mechanisms to help you to deal with whatever stress your job might generate. New Jobs The Future of Jobs Report has identified a variety of areas that are going to see a boom in job opportunities over the next five years. Below we highlight the best courses to give you a headstart and help you succeed in these areas. Content Creation – Jobs in writing content are growing faster than ever, particularly as businesses expand their social media presence. Green Economy Jobs – From wind to solar to hydroelectric power, Alison can help you find a job in any of the future green sectors. AI Economy – This course looks at how AI can be used to solve problems that result in a real economic benefit. Engineering – Alison offers a wide range of engineering courses, ranging from traditional sectors to the industries of the future. Cloud Computing – This course will teach you everything you need to know about online computing infrastructure for both hardware and software applications. Product Development – Rethink the Product Development Process with this course by Steve Blank, an entrepreneur with over thirty years of experience in business management.

Alison has courses on Marketing Ethics, Sales Strategies and everything in between. Roles working with people from different backgrounds – This Human Resources course looks at workplace diversity and working in the globalised world of today. One of the key take-aways from the report is that “for workers set to remain in their roles over the next five years, nearly half will need retraining for their core skills.” Upskilling and retraining are not going to be optional in the workplaces of tomorrow. Alison’s learners are already a step ahead of the competition, and the above courses will help you distinguish yourself even further. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the final point in the report is that “remote work is here to stay”. The move from office to home isn’t showing any sign of reversing in the near future.

My name is Simon Furnivall and I live in Edinburgh, Scotland. Before I worked for Alison, I worked for a number of years in the publishing industry, as both a proof-reader and a copy-writer. I found out about Alison through a former colleague who said there were openings with Alison to work as a Course Creator and that seemed very interesting to me. Why did you pursue the chance to become an Alison Course Creator? I knew of Alison, not through personal experience, but through family members who had done courses and spoke very highly of Alison, as did my former colleague. I was working freelance at the time and the opportunity for more work in the publishing field just seemed to make working for Alison a good fit for me. How did you find the remote Course Creator training? The remote Course Creator training for Alison is very comprehensive and it really does take you from having no experience of being an Alison Publisher to being able to put your first courses out. It teaches you every aspect of being an Alison Course Creator that you need to know and really gives you the confidence to be able to create and publish courses. What was the first course you published on Alison? How did you find the experience? The first course I published as an Alison Course Creator was a Diploma in Cryptocurrency. This is a subject I don’t know a huge amount about but because the content was provided to me, and because I had a good grounding in the Alison training, it made sense very quickly how to put the course together. I was helped by colleagues at Alison who gave me feedback and it ended up published on the site. It was a really enjoyable experience. How has your decision to work for Alison affected your career path? Coming to work for Alison has given me a really strong career path. Before, I was in a freelance position and, with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, things had slowed down and work was difficult to come by. The opportunity to come and work as an Alison Course Creator fit perfectly. Now I’ve earned a career path within Alison because I’ve gone from being a Course Creator to leading my own team of Course Creators. I have a path to move forward with Alison in this role. If you work and succeed with Alison as a Course Creator, then they are more than open to you progressing along a career path with them. What’s the best part of working as an Alison Course Creator? I think the best part of working as a Course Creator with Alison, aside from the career path, is the support that you get from them. You never feel like you’ve been left alone and have to solve problems by yourself. If you have issues, if you need advice on how to structure something then you can contact Alison. They’re wonderful, helpful people who will always have time to reach out to you. If you could publish course that would teach the world, or yourself, anything, what would it be? If I could publish one course that would teach myself anything, it would honestly be teaching myself how to sing. I would love to be able to sing but believe me when I say, you do not want to hear that sound. I would adore to just be able to belt out a tune but it’s just not within me and so I would love a course that would teach somebody completely tonedeaf like myself how to sing.

Through their Global Young Leaders Alliance (GYLA), Aiducation are empowering people around the world through education and skills training. GYLA president, Boniface Mahulo, spoke to the Alison blog about his experiences both as the GYLA president and as an Alison Learner. Aiducation International is an NGO that believes that access to education is the key to empowering individuals and, by extension, their nations. Aiducation provides scholarships to bright students from underprivileged backgrounds in developing countries and through their Global Young Leaders Alliance (GYLA), also gives them the opportunity to use their education to contribute to the well-being of their country’s society. Boniface Mahulo from Kenya, is both an Aiducation Alumnus and the President of GYLA: “GYLA is an international online network, consisting of Aiducation alumni, mentors and partners, that provides continuous learning and development for high performers from low-income families. GYLA offers them personalized guidance and exposure to opportunities. Currently, we have over 1000 active members from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana and the Philippines. Hopefully there are many more to join soon.” GYLA helps Aiducation alumni to empower others via a series of alumni-led initiatives and projects, demonstrating both the immeasurable benefits of education and fulfilling Aiducation’s goal of helping individuals with an aim to benefitting society as a whole. Mahulo is proof that GYLA is succeeding in its aims: “Being elected the first GYLA President was a great honour as it gave me an opportunity to give back to the organization which has had a tremendous effect on who I am today. Personally, GYLA has had a great impact on my life by giving me access to various opportunities like free Alison courses, a free GetAbstract account and many more. I have also had an opportunity to expand my network as we have members from different parts of the world.” In March 2020, like so many other organisations around the world, GYLA had to quickly adapt to pandemic conditions. The closure of universities threatened to disempower GYLA members and stall their journey out of poverty through education. In order not to fall behind in their studies, GYLA members requested access to online education platforms. This was where Alison came into the picture. By partnering with Alison, Aiducation were able to offer education and training to GYLA members throughout the pandemic. “One of the amazing opportunities we had in GYLA this year was the partnership between Aiducation and Alison”, says Mahulo. “I have benefited from this personally as I have successfully completed three courses from Alison – Diploma in Human Resource, Supervision Skills – Managing Groups and Employee Interaction and Corporate Governance. The skills I acquired from these courses have had a tremendous impact on how I work with others and how I approach solving challenges at school and at work. Above all, I have expanded my knowledge of fields that I have always had a passion for. I want to thank Alison for giving us this great opportunity to continue learning and acquiring certificates for free, especially during this challenging time.” Although it was a partnership forged in extremely difficult circumstances, Alison and Aiducation’s partnership is proving incredibly fruitful, as is clear from these testimonials from some of GYLA’s Alison’s graduates: “It was such an amazing opportunity to take the Designing and Implementing Monitoring and Evaluating Systems course with Allison. I believe that, by applying the knowledge and skills I gained from this course, I will be able to see projects through to the end. I’m advising everyone I know to seize the opportunity to learn as much as they can from these courses.” – Ikras Muzoora, Uganda “My course was Nursing Studies – Role of Nurse in Surgical Care. The course taught me many different things, such as the classifications of surgical procedure, types of surgery and pre-operative care. At the end of the course, I took the assessment and I passed! If you fail, you can repeat the assessment which is a great opportunity. I’ve learned a lot from the course and I believe I can advance even further. I’m grateful for this opportunity, thank you to all who made it possible!” – Denise Lisa Amunga, Uganda “I was really impressed with the partnership that Aiducation started with Alison. As a student, the courses help me to gauge myself before the start of online classes in my school. They give me a chance to be productive and keep my mental sharpness. So far, I have completed two courses, and I am about to complete nine more.

Lockdowns, quarantining and self-isolating have meant that regular routines have been disrupted and new, adaptable ways of doing things have had to be found. Working from home is just one of the many “new normals” we had to get used to. Covid-19 has changed the way we work For most of 2020, millions of people around the world have been working from home. Many employees have been working remotely for the first time in their career and often in jobs that have never before been conducted outside of an office setting. For many employees, working from home has been a new, and largely positive, experience. Remote working has meant less commuting, a better work-life balance and even increased productivity. But for all its positives, working from home can lead to difficulties and can take some adjusting. From missing the professional environment to having to be more flexible with time, remote working can throw up a variety of issues. For many people entering the workforce for the first time in 2020, their first job will be a remote job and these new workers won’t have coworkers on-site to help them learn the ropes. However, as some companies have given up their office space completely due to the coronavirus crisis, working from home is here to stay for many employees. Here at Alison, for example, we have downsized our main office space in Galway by 80% and are moving towards a fully remote workplace model. So to help you adapt to the future of work, Alison has selected the key courses necessary to help remote employees transition smoothly to working from home.

Lockdowns, quarantining and self-isolating have meant that regular routines have been disrupted and new, adaptable ways of doing things have had to be found. Working from home is just one of the many “new normals” we had to get used to. Covid-19 has changed the way we work For most of 2020, millions of people around the world have been working from home. Many employees have been working remotely for the first time in their career and often in jobs that have never before been conducted outside of an office setting. For many employees, working from home has been a new, and largely positive, experience. Remote working has meant less commuting, a better work-life balance and even increased productivity.

Webinars allow us to answer your questions directly and to provide tailored assistance in order to best aid you in your educational journey. At the moment, webinars are solely concerned with supporting Learners who are upskilling on the Alison Publishing Tool, however there are plans to expand the Programme to include webinars based on other aspects of Alison’s project. Aashir Rayyan Khan, Alison’s Webinars Lead, tells us a bit more about this exciting development. Aashir, why did Alison set up the Webinar Programme? Alison’s Webinar Programme was introduced as a way of providing additional support to people who wanted to become Self-Publishers or Alison Contractors using the Alison Publishing Tool. We want to give them the opportunity to connect with an Alison team member directly so they can ask questions and learn one-on-one. If you’re interested, you can register for the webinars here. What is the Alison Publishing Tool? The Publishing Tool is our free-to-use web-based tool for creating online courses on Alison. com. You can learn how to self-publish your own courses on Alison by becoming a Qualified Alison Publisher – Level 1. This involves completing two short courses, one of which is the Alison Publishing Tool training course which introduces you to the many features and functionalities of the tool. At Alison, we are experts in the field of online education, and are rigorous in delivering high quality learning materials, so we act as the certificating body and ensure that your courses meet the necessary standards. As part of the process of becoming a Publisher, you will also be assigned an Alison Publishing Mentor, who will guide you through creating your first course. What are the benefits of self-publishing with Alison? Alison is one of the world’s largest free learning platforms for education and skills training. We currently have over 2000 free courses, with over 17 million learners and 3 million graduates. Self-publishing on Alison is a great way to share your expertise with the world, upskill your staff or community, or boost your reputation, all while earning an income at the same time. What are the most important lessons to learn for those interested in using the Alison Publishing Tool? It’s important for users to know about e-learning theory and how to create an online course from a learning perspective. It’s also crucial that they know how best to structure their course. All of this information is available in the Publishing Tool course and the e-learning course. What is an Alison Contractor? Alison Contractors are freelancers that publish courses for third parties on the Alison platform. Contractors must have the Qualified Alison Publisher – Level 3 qualification and have an extensive knowledge of the Publishing Tool. Once qualified, they work on a project-by-project basis, building courses using content provided by either Alison or external publishers. It’s a great opportunity for any Alison Learner. What format do the webinars take? Currently, we do a weekly 40 minute webinar – Webinar Wednesdays – alternating the focus between Self-Publishers and Contractors. The webinar is followed by a Q&A section where we deal with our audience members’ queries. What effect do you hope the webinars will have on how Learners use the Alison Publishing Tool? The webinars provide learners with the opportunity to interact one on one with an Alison Trainer and have all their queries about the Publishing Tool answered directly. The hope is that people at various stages of the onboarding process will be able to gain support from the programme and in time continue their learning journey when we roll out our advanced level webinars. Are there plans to expand the scope of the Webinar Programme in the future? Yes. There is a growing interest in self-publishing and so we expect that we will need to scale the current programing from one self-publishing webinar a week to maybe 5-6 webinars a day, based on demand. We are also currently working on a number of new webinars, including Introduction to Alison, Advance Contractor Training and Alison for Businesses, which will showcase all of our corporate services such as Group Reporting, API and bulk purchasing. Eventually, we want to be able to expand the webinars to Psychometrics and to every other Alison product.

However, Ehan has gone above and beyond his school curriculum and has spent lockdown learning coding with Alison. Ehan is one of our youngest ever graduates and plans on putting his newfound knowledge to good use. Hi Ehan, tell us a bit about yourself! My name is Ehan and I’m seven years old. I’m in Year 3 and my favourite subject at school is Maths. I like playing and watching cricket and football. My favourite cricket player is Glenn Maxwell on the Australian team. My other hobbies are playing the piano and the guitar and also swimming and playing chess. My passion these days is coding. I want to create an app for people who have hearing problems. What the app will do is, whenever someone says something, it will get displayed on the screen so the person who has hearing issues can see what’s been said. That’s a great idea, how did you think of it? I just got the idea one day. I saw someone had made a text-to-speech app and I thought why not a speech-to-text? How did find out about Alison’s online courses? I found out about Alison after my mum registered for a course because she wanted to learn coding. [These classes were facilitated by the Ismaili National Council UK. Through its training institutions, the Aga Khan Economic Planning Board and the Aga Khan Education Board, the Ismaili National Council has a vibrant educational partnership with Alison. You can read more about our work together in community learning here.] She lost interest but I started watching the classes. I became interested and I wanted to learn more and they recommended Alison. Which was the first coding language you started to study and why? I decided to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript first because they’re the fundamentals of web development. I also want to create a website that will teach children subjects like Maths and Science. What is the difference between online learning and learning at school? Well at school I have a teacher to guide me and we also have a set schedule. But at home I have a lot of information available to me online and I can complete work at my own pace. Do you prefer learning online or having a schedule at school? I prefer a bit of both because, at school, I can meet up with my friends and I have a teacher to guide me. But then again at home I’m able to do things in my own time and I don’t have to wait for my classmates to finish doing work. I can just finish it and move onto something else. How has learning from home been during lockdown? It started off pretty exciting – we had our schedule, we had time to do our school work and we had time to do other things but eventually it got boring. Also everyone just went off the schedule and started refusing to do work. What do you think would improve online learning? I think our school classes online would be better if they were on Zoom because right now they just give us all the documents but the teacher isn’t there to guide us. Do you think, in the future, it would be a good idea for classes to take place online as well as in school? Yes definitely. What courses are you studying at the moment? Right now I’m learning Python and I want to learn C#. Which has been the hardest so far? I think Python is pretty difficult but I’d say Java is even harder. Have you thought about what you’d like to do when you grow up? In the future I want to work in NASA and create robots and Artificial Intelligence to work on the ISS and on other future space missions. If you could learn absolutely anything in the world from an Alison course, what would it be? There are a few things I want to learn – astronomy, binary, algorithms and also physics. And if you could make a course, what would you want to teach the world? I’d probably make a course on AI so that people could invent robots to make Earth a better place in the future.

The organisation is founded on a vast network of local volunteers, representing the 32 counties, who have a wealth of knowledge with regard to local records and who provide local genealogical expertise. Alison is delighted to announce that Ireland Reaching Out has joined Alison as a Publisher, and has released an exciting introductory course on Irish Genealogy. Tell us a little about the ideas behind Ireland Reaching Out. Genealogy is one of the top hobbies in the world and Irish genealogy in particular is very popular as more than 70 million people worldwide are estimated to have Irish ancestry. Ireland Reaching Out has built up a robust reputation for helping people navigate the vast amount of family history information online and in doing so has developed a large body of expert advice for those interested in finding out more about their Irish ancestry. How did you come across Alison, and why did you choose to publish with Alison? Ireland Reaching Out have relied on Alison to upskill and train staff members in various Microsoft products, such as Excel. Alison is such an intuitive platform, and has such a wide variety of topics, we felt that it was the perfect platform for sharing our genealogy knowledge with a wider audience, and also providing a repository of guidance for our established members, should they feel the need to brush up on their family history skills. What is the benefit of working with Alison? Alison allows you to build a course with the content you have already developed, rather than have to create new content specifically for the purposes of online learning. Working with Alison also brings awareness of our IrelandXO. com platform to a wider audience, as well as providing our content for free, which is in keeping with our non-profit and volunteer-led policy of helping as many people as possible to reconnect with their Irish place of origin. What advice do you have for prospective publishers on Alison? Do a few Alison courses first. Each is unique and you may find a style that fits your particular type of content, which you can then learn from. What advice do you have for Alison’s learners? Focus on the individual topics and not the whole course. Each journey starts with a single step so enjoy the process and celebrate every new piece of knowledge and how it enables you to go further. Tell us a bit about your forthcoming course, Introduction to Irish Genealogy. Our content has been developed hand-in-hand with some of the top genealogy practitioners in Ireland. The course is designed to introduce key concepts and also to teach research strategies, so you can not only understand what to do but become hands on while you are completing the course. Ireland Reaching Out will assume that our learners know little or nothing about Irish family history, which is why we explain key concepts such as ‘parish’ and ‘townland’, which can often be overlooked by other genealogical learning sources. Not only does this course teach you the fundamentals about Irish family history, it also enables you to create and share profiles of your ancestors online, as well as providing you with a completely free forum for asking questions of the IrelandXO community. Why was providing the course for free through Alison so important? The more people who are skilled in researching their Irish family history, the more people within the diaspora can reconnect with their place of origin in Ireland and the community living there today.","length":3649,"tokens":708,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Ireland Reaching Out – Connecting people overseas and across time","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/ireland-reaching-connecting-people-overseas-across-time","essay_date":"Dec 9, 2020","essay_thanks":"","content":"Ireland Reaching Out (IrelandXO) is a non-profit organisation that has been helping people of Irish descent to reconnect with their ancestors’ place of origin since 2010.

On 13th December 2019, the year ended very badly when the company I worked for closed its doors. The whole of 2020 was just a disaster, and Covid-19 didn’t make it any easier.

I couldn’t find work as a motor mechanic and so I had to consider a career change. And that’s just what I did. My friend, and now my boss, Huw Simpson, came up with the idea of me following a new direction and changing my career. The thought was very scary, but I have been working with computers as a hobby all my life and so turning that into a career seemed like the best option for me. I got offered a job but first I needed competency in software testing, HTML and CSS and I had neither any experience nor knowledge in that area. Not knowing where to start, I began to search the internet. As I browsed through Facebook, I came across Alison and I immediately had to see what it was all about. I used my Facebook to create an Alison account and started learning. I began with Introduction to Software Testing. The layout was very clear and very well presented and, as a result, I pushed through. I started to move on to more advanced courses, like HTML and CSS. The Channel 9 course layout was brilliant and I could see that Alison only offers the best. The knowledge I built up through Alison helped me follow this new direction. Alison is a truly powerful enabler. Within three months, doors just started opening. My friend, Huw, saw my potential and dedication and took me on as an intern. The Alison courses I had completed showed them my willingness to learn and they accepted my Alison certification. From not knowing where to go or how to provide for my family, Alison opened doors that I never thought possible.

Not knowing where to start, I began to search the internet. As I browsed through Facebook, I came across Alison and I immediately had to see what it was all about. I used my Facebook to create an Alison account and started learning. I began with Introduction to Software Testing. The layout was very clear and very well presented and, as a result, I pushed through. I started to move on to more advanced courses, like HTML and CSS.","content_length":855,"content_tokens":183,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"John Taylor: “Alison is a truly powerful enabler.”","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/john-taylor-alison-truly-powerful-enabler","essay_date":"Nov 20, 2020","essay_thanks":"","content":"The Channel 9 course layout was brilliant and I could see that Alison only offers the best. The knowledge I built up through Alison helped me follow this new direction. Alison is a truly powerful enabler. Within three months, doors just started opening. My friend, Huw, saw my potential and dedication and took me on as an intern. The Alison courses I had completed showed them my willingness to learn and they accepted my Alison certification. From not knowing where to go or how to provide for my family, Alison opened doors that I never thought possible. I am now working for a private programmer and will soon be moving from software testing to programming. I still have to learn JavaScript and F# and right now I’m studying the Diploma in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Alison is one of the best things that have happened to me. It changed my opportunities in life.

Would you recommend it and why? Alison has a wide range of classes and I like you that you can get certified which is good for your profile. I have recently recommended Alison to my friends and four of them have already started classes. I recommended Alison to them because you can learn at your own pace. I haven’t taken any classes since high school and, with these classes, I found I felt confident about the learning process. Alison has made me feel like I can complete any course with ease.

What was your first course in Alison. com and why did you choose it? My first course on Alison was in Customer Service. I chose the course because of where I was working back then. I was working as a customer care agent with Tech Mahindra Business Group. I needed certification to accompany my practical skills. How has Alison courses affected your career? I completed the Customer Service training and then proceeded to do the Diploma in Customer Service. The two courses really helped me on the job as I was able to apply the knowledge gained from both courses and be more professional. I was able to attend to clients over the phone and help them to resolve their issues quickly. I was then promoted from the general inbound call center to the high profile customers section where I was able to handle their calls and meet their needs satisfactorily as well. I have taken several courses on Alison and I still have other courses pending. I take courses when I have to change jobs or when I have to complete a business project and have to update my knowledge and acquire more skills to be able to do it properly. I have over twelve years experience in a variety of roles – customer care, training manager, assistant investment manager, research and monitoring officer – and I am currently working as a business development manager. I have taken Alison courses in Business Management, Operations Management, Sales Management and Project Management, to name a few. What is your favorite way to relax from studying? I watch movies, listen to music, play games, go for a walk, or chat with loved ones. Where are you working and what are you studying now? I work with Rockgarden Homecare Agency as the business development manager and I am currently studying the Diploma in Web Business Development and Marketing. What is next for you, in terms of education or work? I will continue to learn at my own pace and complete my study of Web Business Development and Marketing. These days, I prefer to work from home due to the unpredictable nature of the unrest in Nigeria, coupled with the fact that my place of work is in another state. I prefer to work from home and be with my family, and only travel to work when it’s extremely necessary. What will you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? Would you recommend it and why? Alison is a high quality online school that gives you the opportunity to learn at your own pace and receive a globally recognized certificate that you can use to get your dream job or get promoted at your current job. I recommend Alison because I got a job thanks to one of my Alison certificates, and I also got promoted to another job because of my Alison certification. Alison has high quality course content. It is very rich in both text and video material and the assessment exams in between and at the end of each course will really test your understanding of the course.

Alison Publisher, S. M. Waqas Imam, introduces his new course on how to keep a business running in times of crisis. Interruptions in the supply of products and services can arise for a variety of reasons, such as cyber-attacks, bad weather or indeed a pandemic such as the one we are currently experiencing. Increasingly, businesses are realising the importance of having a Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) which allows an organisation to react quickly to potential disruptions to operations. In times of crisis, a robust BCMS helps ensure an organisation has access to supplies and can maintain uninterrupted output, as well as saving money, time and potentially even a company’s reputation. A Business Continuity Management System is much more than just a continuity plan. It includes context analysis of the organisation, risk assessment, drills, internal and external audits, properly allocated roles and responsibilities, management reviews and continual system improvement. A BCMS follows the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, as is the case in a Quality Management System, and allows an organisation to continue operating at a viable level during a disruptive time. In October 2019, the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) issued its latest Business Continuity Management System Standard – ISO 22301:2019. The standard has all the requirements necessary to show companies how to implement a strong system of business continuity management.

What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? The first course I took on Alison was about study skills and I chose this course because I wanted to learn how to effectively study all of the courses I had as part of my first degree. After seeing my first year result in university, I knew I needed to learn study skills if I was going to graduate with a good result. Thankfully, I graduated incredibly well. How have Alison courses affected your career? Alison courses have developed my soft skills in great ways that have helped me with my studies. I recently took a course on Alison called Winning With Communication- Master Your Communication Skills which helped me with class discussions and presentations. I have received good grades in my presentations because of my ability to communicate effectively. Also, I am learning French to help me cope in a French environment [in Côte d’Ivoire] as an English speaker and during lectures delivered in French. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? My favourite ways of relaxing are learning something new outside the classroom and watching movies, particularly animation. What are you studying now? I am currently studying Science-Policy on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services at the University of Felix Houphouet-Boigny in Côte d’Ivoire. It is a master’s programme organised as part of West Africa’s contribution to the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). What’s next for you, in terms of education or work? After my master’s programme, I would like to get a job before I go on to study a PhD. If you could learn absolutely anything in the world from an Alison course, what would it be? It would be a course on interpersonal skills. I think it’s necessary not only for career success, but for life generally. What would you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? Would you recommend it and why? Alison is one of the best online learning platforms with a diverse range of courses for learners. You can find any course you desire to learn.

I have a bachelor’s of science in Immunology and Integrative Molecular Biology and I am graduating this year. I’m always interested in conveying scientific information to the general public in order to pique their interest in science.” How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? I received an email from Alison saying that they were looking for volunteers to translate the coronavirus course at the beginning of the pandemic. At the time, the number of cases in Sri Lanka was very low but after a while we went for an island-wide lockdown and now we are slowly coming back to the new normal. Since it was a very timely project and given my educational experience, I was happy to take part in it. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I studied several courses on Alison. I am a big enthusiast of online learning platforms. I first studied a course on Alison during high school. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? Since misinformation was spreading fast through the internet, I thought it was my responsibility to share accurate information and support the means by which people could get accurate information and knowledge. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? Misleading information can cause chaos. Accurate information about the disease and preventive measures can help communities to cope better. I believe it is important that people follow reputable platforms to get this information, rather than blindly sharing what’s on social media. Tell us a little about your method when translating. During the translation process, Google Translate could not provide a very accurate translation for my language. Since Sinhala sentence structure is different, direct translation can cause a totally different meaning. So I read again and again to confirm the right sense was being translated and there were certain instances when I had to translate whole sentences myself. When the actual word wasn’t in the language’s vocabulary, I described the word and put the English word in brackets for a better understanding. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? I believe that free learning breaks barriers and allows everyone to access knowledge without restrictions. Translation can help to break another barrier, that of language. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? From convocations to higher education, things got postponed for me during lockdown. However, online learning platforms have helped many, including myself, keep ourselves interested by studying topics we haven’t tried before. I have started taking a few courses on mental health and psychology with Alison. This is to have a better understanding of prominent mental health conditions so that I can help and understand people around me who are struggling with such conditions. What would you say to people who might be interested in translating for Alison? I believe translating is a method of sharing knowledge. It provides access to vital information that some people could not access due to a language barrier. So why not contribute to translation!

I am an Indonesian national, based in Jakarta. I have over 10 years professional experience in the private security industry, as regular staff, analyst, consultant and as both a regional and national manager. Prior to that I had also pursued a career in journalism, while teaching English as a foreign language as a side job. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? I was checking out Alison’s Covid-19 course back in February 2020. After finishing the course I noticed that Alison was looking for volunteers to translate their material into various languages including Bahasa Indonesia. So I enlisted as a volunteer. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I have taken some online courses with Alison, although all of them were in English. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? I think it is important that more people in Indonesia get to know the basics of the pandemic better through a good online training course. At the time when I signed up, awareness of the pandemic was not yet really widespread in Indonesia. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? Awareness of the pandemic and its health consequences are fundamental to ensure people will adjust their daily behaviour accordingly to mitigate the health risk. It’s very much the same as in security management – awareness is key. No amount of restrictions or instructions will matter without it. Tell us a little about your method when translating. Basically, I do not translate word for word (as some people tend to do) and instead focus on the contextual meaning of the sentence I am translating. Literal word-for-word translations tend to be confusing for me and I believe a good translation is one that provides ease of understanding, not the opposite. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Knowledge and professional skills are key to advance ourselves in whatever industry or field we are pursuing a career. It used to cost a lot of money to do those courses. Online free courses like Alison’s are a game changer which, in my opinion, help level the playing field for everyone across the globe. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? I have planned to do so but the internet connection has not been reliable enough to do so, ever since the pandemic restrictions were put into effect by the government. We never had a real lockdown here in Jakarta, more like large scale restrictions in public spaces. That being said, me and my family have cut down significantly on going out for non-essential matters since at least March. It has been quite frustrating at times, but at least we have remained infection free due to our own self-imposed precautions. What would you say to people who might be interested in translating for Alison? Go for it. There’s really nothing to lose from doing it. At the very least you will gain more experience while also helping others access the course which is Alison providing for free globally. If you’d like to play your part in overcoming the coronavirus pandemic by helping Alison give people access to the information necessary to keep themselves and their loved ones safe, please get in touch.

And we’re succeeding.”","url":"https://alison.com/blog/mike-feerick-wise-conference-trying-drive-costs-education-zero-succeeding","date":"Jul 29, 2020","thanks":"","content":"In June 2020, the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) hosted its virtual conference on “Education Disrupted, Education Reimagined”. Alison Founder and CEO, Mike Feerick, was invited to speak at the conference. Here is an excerpt from his talk on disrupting the traditional global education system. The education system is in crisis. Covid-19 isn’t the cause, it was already in crisis. The fact is that 93% of people have never been to college and so we need an education system that is far more accessible. We need to educate everybody and we need to educate them now. The systems that are there are just too slow, too expensive and they can’t reach everyone. I believe that the current system is overdue for disruption. I also believe in the promise of what’s possible, which has been brought about by technology and the fact that people are actually willing to use technology. Because while technology may change, behaviour often lags behind. It’s possible to put all knowledge and skills training online for free. Alison has nearly 16 million learners, 3 million graduates and about 2,000 free courses. We’re not just talking about it, we’re doing. Anyone can go onto Alison and study for free. It’s a working model, going for thirteen years. We’ve proven it – you can create a scalable, sustainable platform for free education. But it’s not just about free education. We’re also in the publishing business. Many people don’t realise that on the Alison platform there’s a whole publishing universe where people learn how to use our publishing tool for free. They can then publish in any language, on any subject, at any level and get their content out to anyone worldwide. So we have a situation now in which technology is allowing us to present knowledge for free to learners, and also to give everybody the tools and the training to publish knowledge for free. We have reached a world where everyone can be a teacher, and everyone a learner. We’re trying to create a world where there’s a free flow of knowledge and skills training. We’re trying to drive all costs of education down to zero. And we’re succeeding. And how we’re doing it is to scale the platform. We only have to make cents from every individual who comes on the website, through advertising, to pay our bills. We’re disrupting an education business worth $4 trillion. We’re driving costs to zero so hopefully we can reduce the education of adults down to a business that’s in the billions, not in the trillions. This releases an enormous amount of money that would be available for other important things. Now if you can learn anything anywhere you can be tested on anything anywhere. I’ve said that 93% of the world have never been to college. So how do we assess how smart they are? A lot of companies around the world talk about skill shortages and why wouldn’t there be when there are only hiring college graduates who make up 7% of the world? How then do we assess how smart people are around the world? The truth is that we can do this. In the US in particular, there’s a lot of companies that are no longer looking to formal education when it comes to hiring people. They’re setting them tests – personality tests, cognitive skills tests, testing their verbal reasoning, numeracy reasoning, abstract reasoning. These tests have always been expensive but the truth is they can be free. We’ve launched a free personality test on Alison and we’ll have free cognitive skills tests online later this year. What this enables the world to do is for everyone to be able to find out how smart they are in various different ways and to be able to present this information to an employer. Self-knowledge is key because there’s an enormous amount of people around the world being told they’re not smart unless they’ve paid a college an awful lot of money and received a piece of paper. But we all know this isn’t true. So how do we bring these people into play? We can identify what their strengths and weaknesses are and develop them. We can assess just how smart they are via these tests and in that way make them available for potential hiring and development online. It allows the whole world to engage. And then on the other side, what we can do is go to the employers. Most employers hire in a very lazy way. They put out a short job description and description of the person they want to hire. And they go from there. But actually they can do a lot better. Through our system they could ask a lot more questions and at the same time, open up their hiring to the world. I believe that there’s a change coming in education and training that is going to be a tsunami. The example I often come back to is that, in 1900, the motor car was just invented and made up only 5% of transport in the US. By 1920, only 5% was not motorised and the entire carriage industry was gone. You’re going to see the same thing in education because the technology is here, the systems are free and people need them.","length":4975,"tokens":1096,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Mike Feerick @ WISE Conference: “We’re trying to drive all costs of education down to zero.

You’re going to see the same thing in education because the technology is here, the systems are free and people need them.","content_length":574,"content_tokens":131,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"Diploma in Lean Manufacturing available now!","url":"https://alison.com/blog/diploma-lean-manufacturing-available-now","date":"Jul 27, 2020","thanks":"","content":"The principles and practices of Lean Manufacturing have revolutionised manufacturing and service industries in Japan and we’re now seeing their influence spread across the globe.

I saw some new topics in the course layout which encouraged me to complete the course. How have Alison courses affected your career? Alison has helped me significantly, especially since I included the Diploma in Project Management certification in my resumé. This course has helped me a lot in writing profiles on different projects. What’s your favorite way to relax from studying?

I hold a Higher National Diploma in Purchasing and Supply from the Koforidua Technical University. Due to the love I have for computers, I asked my supervisor to assign me to Information and Communication Technologies tutoring alongside Mathematics during my National Service programme.” How did you learn about Alison? After being introduced to graphic design software and Photoshop by a friend, I wanted to learn more of the basics of graphic designing, aside from the YouTube videos I watched. I learned about Alison through a Google search and was attracted by the simple Alison Logo which made me click on the link leading to your website. What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? Graphic Design – Visual and Graphic Design was the first course I tackled. I needed the basics of graphic design to complement what my friend had introduced me to. How have Alison courses affected your career? The influence of Alison on my career is the opportunity to attach the certificates awarded to me to my educational documents in applying for a BSc in Web Development and Digital Design. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? I never had a feeling for studying online until I found Alison. It gives me the opportunity to pause my course and get back to it anytime. I love to relax on my couch as I operate my laptop and work through the course. Where are you working now?

I learned about Alison through a Google search and was attracted by the simple Alison Logo which made me click on the link leading to your website.

I have a Bachelors Degree in Biochemistry and a High School Diploma in Data Processing. I’m skilled in Warehouse Management Systems, Microsoft Office, Food Service Sanitation and Logistics Management.” What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? I learned about Alison through a colleague. My first course on Alison was a Diploma in Supply Chain Management. The reason for me choosing the Diploma in Supply Chain Management was because, when I got the offer to work as a Tally Assistant for the United Nations World Food Programme, I didn’t have any knowledge of warehousing or supply chain management. These are the main areas you are dealing with and which you need to know about. How have Alison courses affected your career? Alison has given me opportunities that no other institutions would give me. Obtaining a Diploma in Supply Chain Management has helped me in understanding more about my profession and practicing the standard operating procedures. I now have a versatile knowhow of my specialised field as well as having learned the technical approach to so many things concerning supply chains. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? Most of the times, if I’ve been studying for hours, I tend to relax either by playing video games or going for a stroll around the vicinity. Where are you working and what are you studying now? I’m currently working with the United Nations World Food Programme as a Tally Assistant. As a Tally Assistant, I tally the receipt and the dispatch of commodities during internal operations. I implement and maintain accurate stacking, and assist in conducting physical inventory checks to support compliance with internal control procedures and systems. I also prepare accurate tally reports to ensure consistent and prompt accountability for commodity movement from, to and in the warehouse. I supervise the warehouse cleaning after loading and unloading and I manage and control all warehouse activity in the absence of the storekeeper and assistant storekeeper. What’s next for you, in terms of education and work? I’ll be giving more time to study and I’ll continue to learn more from this great institution. For now, I want to further my education in my area of specialisation: supply chains. What would you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? Would you recommend it and why? I’ve referred more than 10 people to Alison. The reason why I refer people to Alison is because I find the courses of study so helpful to my field of work.

My journey with Alison began in 2012. At the time, I was searching Google for some information and materials related to customer care and services. It was at that point that I happened to discover the amazing and informative website that is Alison. What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? My first course was the Diploma in Customer Service. It was very interesting and I found it a very smooth transition when I began testing some of the theory in my work. I found the course easy to understand and to apply so I decided to immediately begin a second course. This was the Diploma in Business Management & Entrepreneurship, another prestigious course containing modern theories alongside interesting subjects. How have Alison courses affected your career? Once I finished the courses, I began to see great results in both my attitude and in my understanding of various aspects of my professional career. The courses gave me the confidence I was looking for in starting discussions with my colleagues and work partners because it was apparent I was a well-informed person, especially when it came to new theories and up-to-date information. I didn’t just have the traditional theory that’s taught in universities. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? I find walking outside in open spaces to be a comfortable and suitable way to throw off any pressure I feel from long hours of study or work. Where are you working and what are you studying now? Currently, I am working in a bank in Syria as a Credit Control Specialist. Also, I continue to still follow new courses that are related to my domain of Finance.

I am a Document Controller with over 8 years of experience in providing engineering and vendor data support on major and minor projects. I possess excellent communication skills strengthened by keen observation and an ability to listen and respond to vendors and co-workers.” How did you learn about Alison? Through referral. About 5 years ago, I was looking for an online site where I could study at my own pace with little or no cost. Then a friend of mine introduced me to Alison online and I must say that I never regretted a moment with Alison. What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? In August 2015, I did the Diploma in Psychology. I chose Psychology because of the nature of my job. I am a document controller and, as such, I interact with various stakeholders and contractors, hence the need for the Alison Diploma in Psychology. How have Alison courses affected your career? Oh, glorious! I have been in the oil and gas industry for a while and I had wanted promotions but simply could not think of how to proceed. I became more frustrated as the clock ticked. This was one of the reasons for searching for online courses. After my first course with Alison in 2015, my performance improved drastically which landed me the desired promotion. I demonstrated strong stakeholder interface management skills in any given project. However, due to my quest for a career change, I took the Alison IT Management – Building Information Systems course and am happy to announce that this certificate brought me a step closer to realising my dream. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? I enjoy the simple things in life – I relax with photography and music. Aside from listening to music and taking pictures with my iPhone, I also take my personal camera around to capture moments. Where are you working and studying now? I work as a document control executive for Seplat Petroleum Plc. Currently, I am pursuing an MBA online at the University of South Wales, UK and should be graduating this year. What’s next for you, in terms of education and work? Well, I am quite ambitious I must admit. I’m working towards holding a managerial portfolio in the next 2 years, and I will probably be counting on Alison for necessary training support. Furthermore, with the experiences I gathered across the oil & gas sector, as well as educational and professional training from Alison and other training providers, I see myself advancing with my career goals aggressively in the next 10 years. Who knows, I might be a CEO by then. My plan is to move into a position of responsibility where I can lead teams. I want to become the person that others seek out for the answers to their difficult problems. If you could learn absolutely anything in the world from an Alison course, what would it be? That’s a very interesting question. In 2017, when I wanted to do my M. Sc. in Information Management I wished Alison could offer me that. So I would be glad if Alison introduced some M. Sc. courses. What would you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? Would you recommend it and why? Yes! Alison is an automatic recommendation for me to anyone.

I’m a Silver Sneakers instructor, Certified Personal Trainer and a Certified Powerlifting Coach. I’m also a Powerlifting World Champion. Having been born premature in my native Queens, New York, I experienced difficulties with learning as a child and school became a difficult place to be. To add to that, I suffered abuse at the hand of my stepfather as a youth, which meant my home life was uncertain and unsafe. With no refuge indoors, I immersed myself in the study of anatomy after a friend introduced me to the names of bones – something I hadn’t even fathomed I could do. Later on, I also found refuge in martial arts and weightlifting. I moved to Seattle in my mid-twenties and became a fitness instructor, later going to school to become a Health and Fitness Technologist. As time progressed, I sought more education to add to my fitness knowledge base and to incorporate that knowledge into my work as a personal trainer, and my own physical fitness as well. Despite my early learning difficulties, I have always pursued education and with the coursework I’ve found through Alison, I have been able to do that at my own pace. Because of my dedication to education, my clients understand why we complete certain exercises, and the members of my powerlifting team understand how to use their bodies to perform lifts optimally.” How did you learn about Alison? I’m always searching for online fitness courses, always wanting to learn something new. During one of my online searches, Alison popped up. I had never heard of Alison before and I did some exploring. I was floored to find that classes in a whole range of subject matters were free. I jumped at the chance to register. What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? The first course I embarked on was the Physical Education – Fitness Training Principles and Methods certificate programme. As a fitness expert, I want to ensure I maintain and expand on my knowledge base through continuing my education in the field of fitness. Alison makes that a possibility. How have Alison courses affected your career? Alison courses have built upon my comprehensive foundation in fitness education. What I’ve learned from these courses is invaluable and it informs my work as a personal trainer, powerlifting coach, and my own physical fitness journey. I offer my clients education in addition to training so they understand what muscle groups are targeted and why. What’s your favorite way to relax from studying? More studying! I value education and I want to remain current on fitness education. I also exercise, which is especially important during these times. Where are you working/what are you studying now? Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I have had to temporarily suspend my work as a Silver Sneakers fitness instructor. What I have been able to do, though, is deliver lunches to my students and others in surrounding senior communities. I’m currently taking several personal training courses and continuing education courses in various subject areas within the fitness realm. What’s next for you, in terms of education or work? In terms of education, my plan is to enroll in a course in Exercise Physiology with the Stanford University’s Center for Health Education. In terms of work, I can’t wait to get back!

In terms of education, my plan is to enroll in a course in Exercise Physiology with the Stanford University’s Center for Health Education. In terms of work, I can’t wait to get back! What would you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? Would you recommend it and why? If you feel you can’t afford quality education, you absolutely can with Alison. Alison courses are free, accredited, and legitimate and you only need to pay if you are seeking a diploma or degree. There is no excuse to not be educated!

I’m a certified Human Resources practitioner and an IT solution provider with over a decade of work experience in the energy industry. I have a BSc in Communication Technology, an MSc in Information Technology, an MSc in Public Administration and I’m currently undertaking a master’s of Technology in Project Management. I like to motivate and empower young people.” How did you learn about Alison? In May 2012, a facilitator in a youth empowerment programme I was participating in introduced us to Alison. He told us Alison was free and would provide enormous opportunities to help prepare us for an awesome career. What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? My first course on Alison was the Diploma in Human Resources. I completed it in June 2012. I choose this course because I needed to build a solid foundation in HR. How have Alison courses affected your career? My first e-learning experience was studying with Alison. This experience has helped me achieve excellence in all my subsequent e-learning experiences. Alison spurred me into completing two MSc programmes via e-learning in the space of five years. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? My favourite way to relax from studying is listening to soft music. Where are you working now? Presently, I work for North South Power Company Limited as a Human Resources business partner, focusing on recruitment and separation. The company won a concession to run Shiroro Hydroelectric power plant for a minimum of 30 years effective from 1st November 2013. Of course, I am also studying while working. I am currently undertaking a master’s of Technology in Project Management with the Federal University of Technology. My anticipated graduation date was originally 2021, before the Covid-19 pandemic altered the school calendar. What’s next for you, in terms of education? I hope to proceed to a PhD in Project Management Technology as soon as I am done with my master’s programme. If you could learn absolutely anything in the world from an Alison course, what would it be? I look forward to a time when Alison might start running degree programmes in contemporary topics. Alison has written its name in gold, but there is always room for expansion. What would you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? Would you recommend it and why? I have recommended Alison to so many people here in Nigeria. Most of them have completed multiple courses and are quite happy with their progress. I don’t just stop at recommending Alison to friends and colleagues, I guide them on the basic skills they require to succeed on it. One of the main reasons I recommend Alison is because it is free, and the content of the courses is rich and engaging.

After 5 years as an Assistant Risk Officer I was called for an interview for the position of a Risk Officer, which I passed and was promoted.” What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? My first courses on Alison were a Diploma in French and a Diploma Risk Management. I studied French part time with the University of Botswana but because of time constraints I couldn’t finish the course. I decided instead to take it through Alison at my own pace and in my own space. Risk Management was also an interesting course because of my investment interests. How have Alison courses affected your career? I learned new French words and, through audio lessons, my comprehension and my pronunciation got better. Through the Risk Management course, I learned how insurance works and what is entailed in creating policies for different ages. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? I enjoy training, watching TV and having fun with my family. Where are you working now? I’m currently working for Diamond Trading Company Botswana as a Risk Officer. I’m also studying Swahili and some other courses on the side, like Project Management and Security Studies. I chose them to gain an insight into how projects are carried out and to upgrade my knowledge in the management of assets and of business risks. What’s next for you, in terms of education and work? To keep abreast with new technology courses and think about starting something as an entrepreneur, more specifically to sell car parts. I have done a bit of research into the car parts business and have found out that the market here in Botswana is not able to meet the demand. Although there are spare parts shops, they are still failing to supply the required parts and some supply either expensive or substandard parts. If you could learn absolutely anything in the world from an Alison course, what would it be? I would love to learn anything to do with cybercrime or coding. In these modern and sophisticated times, one needs to be abreast with the latest trends and technology in order to counter fraudulence by people we communicate and do business with online.

My education started out in chemistry but chemistry was not my forté, so I chose to change my major to computer science and that’s been my career for the last 34 years. Not too long ago, I decided to go into education, teaching IT. I’m now working at a federal programme called Job Corps which trains the workforce, for applicants aged 16 to 24. We have about 125 locations in the United States. It’s really exciting because students get hands-on training. Now that we’re in the time of covid-19, we have distance learning so we’re working from home, trying to help students. I will say that my career in IT wasn’t straightforward. I’ve worked for about 20 employers, compared with my dad who worked for one employer his whole career.” How did you learn about Alison? I got my degree in 1986 and, as I went along in my career, I realised my skills were getting dated and I decided to return to college after 20 years. After that programme, I felt like there were some things missing, that there were some components that the college really didn’t touch on. And so I was looking for other ways to train. I’m always looking for other forms of knowledge to tap. I was trying to find something that looked legitimate. At the time Alison was starting out and right away I discovered a curriculum for Business Administration. I wanted to see how this compared to my college experience and I was quite pleased with the components and what it covered, entrepreneurship in particular. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? I like working with my hands so I’m often out in the yard digging. We live near some freshwater lakes and, right now, I’m refurbishing a small rowboat. Where are you working/what are you studying now? At Job Corps, I teach office administration, which is pretty encompassing, from having to learn the applications for Microsoft Office Suite to showing students various equipment that is used in the office. One of the things they ought to know is dealing with money. We’ve encountered a free quick books curriculum that we use for teaching how to make bank transactions and how to write a cheque and things of that nature. How has Alison affected your career? So the thing that I recall in the business administration programme is that, if you’re an entrepreneur, you should have a continuance of business plan, in case things go haywire like they are now. I was living in New York at the time of 9/11 and our data centre was cut off from the rest of the world. So suddenly you have to figure out what to do and you don’t know how long it’s going to last. That course on Alison took you through the many steps and phases of what you should be thinking about to develop that plan – to test it and to be ready to execute it when the time comes. That was a tough module because it really made you think. What would you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? Would you recommend it and why? First of all, I would say that it’s legitimate. Somebody didn’t form this just as a way to make money. When you complete the programme of study and you earn a credential and can receive a document that’s official. And it expresses to a potential employer that you’ve paid the dues of learning something that took effort. There’s a lot to discover at Alison. When I first encountered it I thought “oh there’s just gonna be a little bit on here” but the range of topics covered was very deep and wide. And they’re not all just digital in nature. I teach with other instructors who teach Certified Medical Assistants and that is typically tough to teach in a distance learning mode.

Jlatuh, the first child of over fifteen children. I am married and have three daughters. I hold a BSc in Public Administration as well as a host of other certificates from The Young African Leadership Initiative Network, an initiative of the US State Department. I am currently serving as Director for the National Library in Liberia.” How did you learn about Alison? Before the Ebola crisis in my country, I was discussing my options online with a counselor at Atlantic University. However, the conversation couldn’t continue because I was unable to raise the fees to attend the university. I was so frustrated that I started searching the internet for an alternative. I came across Alison. When I read about it, I knew that Alison could substitute for the Atlantic University. What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? My first course was Human Resources. I was working in the HR department and I knew Alison could help to better my time in that department. How have Alison courses affected your career? Discovering this unique platform has changed and shaped my career. I gained great insights from the courses I took advantage of. With a Diploma in HR from Alison, I went from being a secretary in the HR department to being promoted to HR Personnel. Later that year, I was again promoted to Assistant Head of HR. The certificate in the Ebola course gave me influence in my community and I was able to save lives. In my country, ebola killed people but misinformation also did. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? After studying, I relax by lying on my bed and listening to motivational speakers like my Pastor, Philemon A. Tarpeh, the late Dr. Myles Munroe, John C. Maxwell, etc. Where are you working now? I’m currently working at the National Library and studying courses on Leadership, Library Management and Mastering Public Administration at the graduate school in my country. What’s next for you, in terms of education or work? What’s next for me is to complete my master’s studies, engage in more leadership training to better equip myself and start to do what I really love to do, which is to develop our nation’s next generation of leaders. Youth human capital development, this is my real work. If you could learn absolutely anything in the world from an Alison course, what would it be? It would be to learn how to more effectively connect with my team – developing the ability to give constructive feedback and to seek the feedback of my team.

I was the last child born to a polygamous family in Rivers State. I studied Law at Rivers State University as a result of my academic experience with Alison and other online learning platforms.” How did you learn about Alison? I found Alison after finishing secondary school in 2013. I was searching for academic resources on Google, due to a burning desire for quality education, when I stumbled on the platform. After browsing the course catalogue, I was shocked by the courses that were available for free. So I did not hesitate in hitting the sign up button. What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? English Grammar was my first course on this platform. Since the age of 9, I’ve always wanted to be a writer. But how would that be possible when many people mocked of my horrible English? Their mockery, however, inspired me to study more diligently and I began to improve my knowledge of the mechanics of English grammar. Alison provided the foundation on which I now learn with ease and confidence. On the completion of this course, I enrolled in other courses such as: English Language and Literature, Journalism, Legal Studies, Web Developing, French and Blogging among others. How have Alison courses affected your career? All these courses have significantly shaped my academic competence and have helped me in choosing a suitable career. First, the Blogging course gave me the tools through which I acquired many readers who began to love my writing. Second, Alison opened my eyes to the existence of online learning generally. Through it, I was able to discover other platforms. Finally, it also made me more decisive in choosing my legal career and in studying diligently for all my university exams. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? Sitting in front of a computer for several hours can be tiring and straining. My favourite way to relax from studying is to play soccer with my friends to keep my body fit. Since all the courses are self-paced, I was able to map out time for each course – time for a tea break, and time for writing and soccer. That way, I was able to have an impactful relaxation. What are you studying at the moment? Currently, I’m a student at the Nigerian Law School, Abuja and a few months from now, I will become a Legal Practitioner. I have also advanced to full time academic and creative writing. My first journal article was published in 2019 in the African Journal of International Energy and Environmental Law, and my first novel has been submitted for publication. What’s next for you, in terms of education and work? As a young person, I believe that my little achievement so far is just a step that will take me to another phase of life. After my law school programme, I plan to go into legal practice and consultancy for a few years in order to save enough money to further my education. If you could learn absolutely anything in the world from an Alison course, what would it be? If I could learn absolutely anything in the world from an Alison course, it would be Cyber Security. This is because, as the world is advancing to a highly digital era, I’d like to be able to effectively protect myself and my career progress from malicious attacks. What would you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? Would you recommend it and why? Alison is one of the free learning platforms that prepared me for the future I am currently enjoying, and for the one I’m expecting. Initially, I felt I was wasting my time and energy, but I didn’t know I was building strong bricks for my career.

I brought them to the beach and to the park and having other children around became just part of the everyday routine. It was very positive for my son to enjoy the company of other kids on a regular basis. I showed the parents my Alison Diploma in Children Studies, along with my other documents, and it helped give a really positive picture to parents, who trusted me to look after their children. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? I sing and play the piano and I also love playing chess. I’m teaching my children how to play chess too. I love to play tennis whenever I get the chance. Apart from this, I really just enjoy the precious family time with my kids. Where are you working and what are you studying now? I’m a qualified pedagogue in Germany. However, in order to provide appropriate care for my disabled son, I’m currently a stay at home parent. That’s why I started to study tourism at Alison as well. However, I started this before the corona epidemic and now am not working in that area. I get to help my children with school and homework during Corona-times. As a high-risk group, they’re still staying home. What’s next for you, in terms of education? I would like to study professional health care, nursing services or medical care. If you could learn absolutely anything in the world from an Alison course, what would it be? I think it would be a diploma course that would make me qualified to be a foster carer so that I could help more children. I’ve never been a foster carer, but I’m aware you don’t need to study anything in order to do it, other than some general training from the fostercare services. I think it would be really helpful to require qualifications in order to make sure that a parent wasn’t accepted just because of their character and family, but that they would have to have more than just experience with children and have taken the time to study the many matters a foster carer has to deal with. What would you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? Would you recommend it and why? Yes, I would recommend it. If as a parent or for any other reason, you stay at home a lot, it’s a very good chance to study. I think during Corona-times this could be interesting for even more people than usual. Alison courses help you get a really good picture of the whole subject or if you have already worked in an area, it’s still helpful to refresh the knowledge. You can also show Alison certificates to the relevant people in your work Interviews. It’s free to learn and you don’t need to pay for diplomas. However, you’ll be so proud that you might want to have a framed certificate afterwards, and you can buy this too.

I have a master’s in Entomology and Forensic Science, which I’ve just completed at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka Campus. I’m not currently working but I’m hoping to soon start my PhD in Global Health.” How did you learn about Alison? My first encounter with Alison’s online courses was in 2012, during my bachelor’s studies, when I came across an Alison ad online. I was interested in taking some of the courses but I didn’t have the time then. Later, in 2013, I missed out on certain training that I was supposed to take part in, and decided to utilise my free time by training with Alison. What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? The first course I successfully completed was a Certificate in Global Health Initiative: Malaria Awareness. I chose this particular course because I was a Biological Sciences student at the time. I wanted something to boost my scientific skills but I was also thinking about expanding my professional experience to not only include the lab, but also issues of public interest affecting the communities around me. It was indeed helpful. How have Alison courses affected your career? I later enrolled in, and completed, a Diploma in Tourism Studies to supplement my career path. I was particularly fascinated by the history of tourism and the contemporary issues underpinning the tourism industry. I gained confidence in accepting other cultures and it also built my communication skills. I succeeded in winning a scholarship for my master’s degree partly because of the strength an Alison certificate added to my academic credentials. It really was a milestone on my career path. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? In my free time, I read and write scientific articles. I also write a blog.

I would highly recommend Alison for everyone, but most importantly for people who want to broaden their skills or otherwise change their career. The flexibility of the learning process, the simplicity of the material, the interaction of the Alison team and the patience of the platform is not to be missed.

Companies usually operate multiple management systems and so need a centralised managing system in order to manage, audit and improve the overall running of the business. Courses on ISO management system standards are in high demand globally. The common ISO management system standards are: ISO 9001 – Quality Management System (QMS) Standard ISO 14001 – Environmental Management System (EMS) Standard ISO 45001 – Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OH&SMS) Standard Professional training bodies usually offer Short Awareness Courses, Two Day Internal Auditor Courses or Five Day Lead Auditors Courses on the three different management system standards. These courses are usually expensive and specific courses on Integrated Management Systems (IMS) are rarely available, even though the need for IMS is felt in the corporate and industrial sectors across the globe. Often companies simply integrate their management system standards in order to reduce costs, improve efficiency and avoid repetitive work for different management systems. However, employees are usually only trained in one management system and so they don’t have any idea as to how integrated management systems work. This means companies have to facilitate expensive training in each management system for every employee. What companies need is a course in which the concept of IMS is taught alongside common management systems standards. At Alison, we’ve designed an exclusive diploma level course to meet this global demand. The course is rich in learning activities, questions, graphics and assessments. It covers the concept of Integrated Management Systems (IMS) in the initial module, along with the different approaches companies use to integrate systems at both basic and advanced levels. The course also compares common management system standards, including the latest ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 standards. It discusses these standards in detailed, individual modules and provides assessments on each management system.

I am Burundian and I live and work in Bujumbura in Burundi, the country of the great lakes of central Africa. I work for an American international humanitarian aid organisation in Bujumbura. My first job in the humanitarian sector was with a German organisation. Guided by universal humanitarian principles, I was able to adapt and manage the work in a variety of situations, sometimes in difficult circumstances. I’m pleased to have helped people who were in difficulties to be able to overcome them. Over the course of my work, I had the chance to do various certified training courses in areas like operations management, supply management, risk management and database management.” How did you learn about Alison? I learned about Alison through searching the internet for companies who offer courses in logistics. This is how I discovered the website alison. com. What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? I remember that my first course was the Diploma in Supply Chain Management. I chose it because I work for an international NGO that deals with logistics and I wanted to improve my performance in managing operations, logistics and supply chains. As you know, work systems change day by day. Despite our knowledge in a particular area, there’s always a need to update it. By the end of the course, I had more knowledge about the supply chain. How have Alison courses affected your career? After having studied courses on Alison, I didn’t immediately notice a change in my career, in terms of how I was carrying out my daily work. But gradually as time went on, there were consequences from the courses that helped me carry out my job better. The mid-year and end of year evaluations showed the results of having taken the Alison courses. I had better results in in my evaluation compared to the previous year. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? After work or study, I like to exercise – play basketball, go jogging – and sometimes to just sit with my friends and joke around. I often go to the beach at Lake Tanganyika, it’s my favourite way to relax. Where are you working now? Currently, I’m working in Burundi with an American organisation which works with Congolese refugees living in camps in Burundi, and with repatriated Burundians who have been living in neighbouring countries (Tanzania, DRC and Rwanda among others). I work in the logistical support programme as an officer in Repatriation Operations, Transfers and Transit Centre Management. What’s next for you, in terms of education or work? Following my current work overload, I plan to start studying more Alison courses in early 2021 but I don’t know yet what kind of course. What would you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? Would you recommend it and why? Alison is an international organisation which offers a diverse range of training courses. For me, it’s a rich and inexhaustible source of knowledge, know-how and innovation. I would recommend Alison to all my friends.

To further my career, I’ve embraced online education with zeal in order to develop.” How did you learn about Alison? I learned about Alison from a friend way back in 2014 when I had just started my first job. What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? My first course was a Diploma in Project Management because I wanted to broaden my knowledge in project management. It was free to study and this motivated me to take it up. How have Alison courses affected your career? I have managed to apply the knowledge gained from the course to my everyday work. The knowledge I’ve gained from the Project Management course influences all decisions I make in relation to project activities – in terms of planning, directing and managing resources to achieve what’s in the best interest of the stakeholders and of the entire organisation. For example, when a field activity is going to take place, I have to review the work plan, budgets and availability of resources so as to ensure it runs smoothly and efficiently. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? While not working or studying, I take time to be with my family, visit friends and watch movies and series. Where are you working now? Currently, I am working with the non-profit organisation FH I360 in Uganda and studying to be a Certified Public Accountant at the Uganda Management Institute, one of the most prominent institutions in the country. Studying to become a certified accountant helps me to compete favourably in the corporate world as I aim to become an auditor. What’s next for you, in terms of education? I’m looking at advancing my education through a master’s programme. In the future, when finances allow, I would like to study a master;s in Business Administration. I would like to get involved and work in the nonprofit humanitarian industry in a risk and compliance department. If you could learn absolutely anything in the world from an Alison course, what would it be? I have plans to take up a Human Resources course at Alison because I want to learn more about managing human capital. With Alison, knowledge is free as there is no tuition. What would you say to someone if they asked you about Alison? Would you recommend it and why?

I worked as a Radio DJ for 8 years and then moved to the corporate world after finishing my home study programme.

I chose to take Business and Legal Studies with Alison, to enhance my knowledge and understanding of business operations, particularly in Human Resource management.” How did you learn about Alison? What was your first course on Alison, and why did you choose it? A friend from the US referred me to Alison and I was interested. I chose the Business and Legal Studies course to give me a better understanding about my work in Operations and Human Resources. The course I took on Alison helped me to better understand Operations Management, the Employee Cycle, and managing on a large scale within an organisation. The course impacted my work by broadening my knowledge of Human Resource Management, Employee Relations and understanding different Management Styles. It wasn’t a case of overnight learning. Learning was a day to day process. One of the reasons I’m thankful for choosing the programme is that it bettered my understanding of the different styles of how to manage an organisation. How have Alison courses affected your career? The classroom is not the only method of learning.

Climbing up the ladder in the corporate world is a matter of your agility and perseverance when it comes to learning. Learning is my real job. What’s your favourite way to relax from studying? I relax from studying by making sure to apply what I am studying. Where are you working now? I am working in an American manufacturing company in Manila. I’m now an Assistant Manager in Human Resources. I also manage Learning & Development in the organisation. What’s next for you, in terms of education or work?

My name is Eurika and I’m from South Africa. I have a degree in Medical Science and I specialised in Neuroscience. As a medical scientist with a passion for neuroscience, I want to continue changing lives with the information that we as medical specialists have at our disposal. I enjoy doing research and supplying information and medical advise to many. My focus is on offering free consultations to those who are from destitute spaces. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? I took the coronavirus course that Alison offered at the beginning of the year. Afterwards, I saw a notification outlining that Alison was looking for translators for the course. I was excited because that is something I already do locally. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I have studied a number of courses through Alison which have helped in enhancing my passion for the medical industry. Before completing my qualification, I had to drop out from university in 2012 because of finances. However, when I found out about Alison, I realised that my passion could still be exercised. I enrolled and acquired certificates which added value to the volunteering work I was doing at various organisations, such as the Cancer Association of South Africa. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? I offered to translate because I believe in sharing information with our people. After completing the course, I noted how efficient and also very easy to follow it was. I knew that once translated, even those who are not from a medical background would be able to benefit from it. We believe in Ubuntu here in South Africa – that unity is built through offering help and guidance to others. I believe it is that nature, instilled in us from a young age, that encouraged me to volunteer. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? As the saying goes, “It is far better to be forewarned than forearmed!”. Information goes a long way, especially when it comes to health. If people know what they need to do to reduce the risks of infection, the better it will be for us all. Africa already has a very stretched health system, the least we can do is come together through quality information and ensure that everyone is safe from the get go – so that we are not faced with a similar situation as with ebola. Tell us a little about your method when translating. My method of translating was to review and edit the translated content on the Alison draft. Then I did my own separate translation directly from English and compared this translation to the Alison one to see what differences there were. This way I could ensure that I used the right idioms and phrases that placed emphasis on the key words. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Free learning is very important, because an informed nation becomes a compassionate nation. Free education also gives the learner a sense of satisfaction and confidence. I referred the coronavirus course to others and the fact that they received a certificate in the end made it more worthwhile for them. People want the honor of having a certificate and knowing that they have completed something that can help save lives. Translating information to many languages ensures that we reach even unreachable and destitute places. It is an honor to know that, through translations, we have covered more ground and offered quality content to those who need it the most. In English, we see daily posts, adverts, etc. But for those who aren’t fluent in English, that data is lost. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? I am currently enrolled in a course in nutrition. The lockdown has been good and also a wake up call. Because of my profession, I have had to be readily available at all times to offer community health support wherever needs arise. What would you say to people who might be interested in translating for Alison? I would quote my life motto which is “If the pen can convey the intended message, then don’t let the ink run out!”. If your time and efforts in translating the content can bring about change that is needed, then please commit to it. There is no honour in keeping information that could have saved many in your community to yourself. Through this platform, you will be able to add value to lives you may never meet and live with this fulfillment for the rest of your life. What will you say to future generations when they ask, “What role did you play during the 2020 pandemic?”.

As the saying goes, “It is far better to be forewarned than forearmed!” Information goes a long way, especially when it comes to health. If people know what they need to do to reduce the risks of infection, the better it will be for us all. Africa already has a very stretched health system, the least we can do is come together through quality information and ensure that everyone is safe from the get go – so that we are not faced with a similar situation as with ebola. Tell us a little about your method when translating. My method of translating was to review and edit the translated content on the Alison draft. Then I did my own separate translation directly from English and compared this translation to the Alison one to see what differences there were.","content_length":944,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Eurika Thabile Mogane: our Zulu language translator","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/eurika-thabile-mogane-zulu-language-translator","essay_date":"Jul 10, 2020","essay_thanks":"","content":"This way I could ensure that I used the right idioms and phrases that placed emphasis on the key words. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Free learning is very important, because an informed nation becomes a compassionate nation. Free education also gives the learner a sense of satisfaction and confidence. I referred the coronavirus course to others and the fact that they received a certificate in the end made it more worthwhile for them. People want the honor of having a certificate and knowing that they have completed something that can help save lives. Translating information to many languages ensures that we reach even unreachable and destitute places. It is an honor to know that, through translations, we have covered more ground and offered quality content to those who need it the most. In English, we see daily posts, adverts, etc. But for those who aren’t fluent in English, that data is lost.","content_length":972,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Eurika Thabile Mogane: our Zulu language translator","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/eurika-thabile-mogane-zulu-language-translator","essay_date":"Jul 10, 2020","essay_thanks":"","content":"Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic?

My background is in education. I taught in a private school for many years, working both in the classroom and on the management team. I decided I needed to take a break from teaching in the classroom as it can get all-consuming. I still enjoyed teaching, so I continued with some private tutoring and tried my hand in a few other avenues. How did you discover Alison, and what was your experience as a learner? I came across Alison a few years ago and completed a couple of courses. I am passionate about learning, especially free and equal learning for all. I thoroughly enjoyed those courses and found them well structured. Why did you pursue the chance to become an Alison Contractor? Towards the end of the year, I received an email that Alison was looking for publishers. I loved the idea of designing information and putting it on the platform, so I applied. How did you find the remote Contractor training? The contractor training was straightforward and next thing I knew, I was completing my first course which was a Diploma in Fashion Design. It was great learning both the content and how to structure it in a user-friendly manner. Tell us about your work coordinating the translations of Alison’s coronavirus course. Towards the middle of February, I was approached by Mike Feerick [Alison’s CEO] to help coordinate a project on the coronavirus. Alison was one of the first platforms to get information on the coronavirus to the public. Mike had a vision to translate the course into many languages so people could learn about the virus in their own vernacular. It was rewarding seeing the keen interest of our volunteers to contribute, as well as seeing the various courses come to live on the platform. What’s the best part of working as an Alison Contractor? I have thoroughly enjoyed working for Alison and I do not see myself returning to the classroom any time soon. During the pandemic, being able to work from home has been ideal. It kept me occupied and gave me a purpose. It is also mobile. Once the economies around the world open, and there is an internet connection, I can work anywhere in the world.

First off, I am 27 years old, a Nigerian and a B. Eng. degree holder in Electrical & Electronic Engineering. Prior to my working with Alison, I did freelance work, including writing articles for a friend’s blog, annotating pictures and videos for deep learning applications, and also installing distribution transformers and solar panels. I also started a blog, where I write about energy and power systems. You can check it out here. How did you discover Alison, and what was your experience as a learner? Alison is probably the first e-learning platform I discovered back in my university days. That was around 2012 or so. A friend introduced me to the platform. When I checked it out, I liked how easy it was to navigate so I proceeded to study a course. The course structure made it easy for me to understand the course content. And, there were assessment questions too to help me learn more. Learning with Alison was a good experience, and still is. Why did you pursue the chance to become an Alison Contractor? I love to teach and spread knowledge because it gives me the opportunity to positively impact other people and also learn more in the process. So, when Alison came calling for Contractors, it struck me as a great chance to help spread knowledge to millions of people around the world. I grabbed the chance. Also, it was an opportunity to earn some cash. How did you find the remote Contractor training? Amazing and well structured, from the training courses to the test course, and on to developing courses which are now live. There was enough time to learn about the Alison publishing methods and I had a mentor who was ready to answer my questions. With the help of my assigned mentor, Kieran [Alison’s Instructional Designer], it all went great. What was the first course you published on Alison? How was it? The first course I published was titled Introduction to Biomedical Research. This course came at a time when many people wanted to know about the clinical process in biomedical research. The development of the course was easy, thanks to the mentorship of my assigned mentor, Kieran. The course is video based so I had to do some video editing with the aim of easing the learning process. The knowledge from the training courses was instrumental in developing this course and other courses. How has your decision to work for Alison affected your career path? At first, I didn’t think I would be able to handle both the Alison work and some other freelance work that I do. But it turned out I could handle it all well. My time management skills greatly improved. What’s the best part of working as an Alison Contractor? The flexibility of working from home. I actually started working as an Alison contractor when the Covid-19 pandemic was getting serious in my country. So when the country went into lockdown, I wasn’t completely locked down. I could still make an impact by developing courses for people to learn. And even though there were deadlines for development of courses, it still afforded me the liberty to develop the courses at my own pace. If you could publish a course that would teach the world, or yourself, anything, what would it be? It would be a course on solar power systems. The course would be about the step by step process of designing and installing solar power systems for homes. It would be comprehensive and would most certainly be a skills-based course. There are less resources about this subject on the internet today.

I did my undergrad in Physical Education and I then moved on to complete my master’s degree in Library and Information Science from Alagappa University. I then pursued my PhD in the same discipline from Bharathidasan University. I worked as a librarian at Murugappa Polytechnic College, Chennai for nearly four years. At present, I am working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Library and Information Sciences, Central University of Punjab, India. I am also a qualified umpire for the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association. How did you discover Alison, and what was your experience as a learner? My PhD topic was concerned with e-learning for library and information science students. I needed to create an e-learning platform to deliver my course content to the target audience and to be able to assess their performance, as well as the effectiveness of the course. I started looking for existing e-learning initiatives across the globe. This is where I came to know about Alison. I fell in love with the interface and started using it to enhance my knowledge on certain topics and skills. As a learner, the interface is well designed and easy to use, the content is specific and the use of multimedia is enriching. As a whole, I would rate this platform highly. Why did you pursue the chance to become an Alison Contractor? As mentioned, my PhD topic was related to e-learning and I am a great fan of open access resources because not many people can afford the cost of accessing scholarly content. Hence, when I received the email regarding the chance to become an Alison contractor, I liked the idea and thought I would give it a try. I thought that, if I get selected, I can contribute something beneficial to learners across the globe. This is the least I can do as researcher, teacher and lifelong learner. How did you find the remote Contractor training? To be honest, I thoroughly enjoyed each and every phase of the training. The training was so well planned, starting from the basics of e-learning, an overview of the publishing tool and finally designing a test course that meets the standards of Alison. I enjoyed all the phases and took it one at a time. In the end, I learned a lot about different aspects of e-learning and course designing. What was the first course you published on Alison? My first course published on Alison was the Diploma in Effective Writing Skills. I followed the instructions given to me and formatted the contents according to the requirements of Alison. I have to thank Kieran [Alison’s Instructional Designer] here because this was my first course and whenever I had a query, he was so friendly and would guide me accordingly. This made me feel relaxed and helped me to focus on the course. When the course appeared on the Alison website, I was filled with joy. It came out very well and has a good number of learners enrolled in it. How has your decision to work for Alison affected your career path? It has been a dream come true for me. As a researcher and teacher myself, it was a god-send as I learned about e-learning in-depth – the principles to follow while creating e-content and how to use different media to make the course livelier. In this pandemic, most teachers have to resort to the use of online platforms. With the knowledge and experience I gained and am still gaining from Alison, I relish designing online content and online teaching now. What’s the best part of working as an Alison Contractor? I have a doctorate in the field of library and information sciences, but I have designed courses on thermodynamics, service marketing and so on. While designing a course outside my discipline, I learn about these concepts. Alison has exposed me to different domains of knowledge and as a library professional, I love that. For me, this is the best part and I’m looking forward to working in more diverse disciplines. If you could publish course that would teach the world, or yourself, anything, what would it be? As a teacher, researcher and library professional, I see different types of learners with diverse information needs. In this digital era, anyone can access information with the help of the internet and most users just rely on Google and Wikipedia. This can result in plagiarism among students and researchers as they lack the knowledge in crediting the owner of the original source. Hence, these are the course I would like to bring into the world: Information Literacy Skills in the Digital Era (The ability to identify, locate, use, and evaluate information); Academic Writing and Search Strategies (The differences between assignments, term papers and research papers. How to search the internet, various types of searching techniques, how to ensure the information is authentic and so on); Plagiarism and Publication Ethics. (Concepts of plagiarism, types of plagiarism, need for referencing and citing, tips to avoid plagiarism and ethical practices of research.)","length":5064,"tokens":1034,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Meet Abu KS – a Contract Publisher based in India","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/meet-abu-ks-contract-publisher-based-india","essay_date":"Jul 7, 2020","essay_thanks":"","content":"Abu, tell us a bit about your background before Alison I hail from Chennai, the capital city of Tamil Nadu, India.

My name is Eglė Šerutytė and I am from Lithuania. I have lived both in Ireland and in Iceland. I graduated in Public Administration from Klaipėda University and then I went to Turkey to do my internship. When countries were about to close their borders, I decided to stay in Turkey, so I’ve spent 5 months (instead of 3) in this amazing country. I just came back this week, so I am trying to find a job and a place to volunteer here in Lithuania. I really love traveling and interacting with people from all around the world. It’s one of the reasons why I enjoy participating in projects like this one. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? I found out that Alison was looking for translators when I was searching for free online courses. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? Actually I hadn’t a lot of experience with Alison before translating this course. I had an account but I hadn’t yet found the will to start some courses, even though I wanted to. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? I really wanted to help people during this crisis but it was really hard because I don’t speak Turkish and in the city where I was staying people didn’t speak English. I couldn’t help people in Lithuania either because I was in Turkey, so translating courses was an attempt to help Lithuanians remotely. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? Knowledge is powerful tool. I guess we should get used to the fact that coronavirus is going to be around for a while. Even though there is no cure for coronavirus yet, reliable and accessible information sources are extremely important. It is important because it helps to decrease the impact of the virus by making people aware. The more knowledge people have, the more people know how to protect themselves and others from coronavirus. Tell us a little about your method when translating. I am not professional translator so I was using literal translation as much as possible. There were some English expressions that I couldn’t translate into Lithuanian (because we don’t have them in our language), so I had to use the Lithuanian expressions without changing the meaning of the sentences I was translating. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Not everybody is able to pay for learning. There are a lot of gifted people in the world but education is not accessible to them because they don’t have the money. And so because people are unable to get education, they can be trapped without any chance of reaching their life goals. As I already mentioned, knowledge is powerful tool. Not everyone is a polyglot and no one should be restricted in their ability to learn simply because they do not speak certain languages. There’s a lot of useful information sources which could help people but those sources are not always accessible because they are in different language. So translating those useful sources into different languages is the only way to let the majority of people benefit from them. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? I haven’t been learning with Alison yet but I am sure I am going to do it in the future. Even though I was far away from my relatives during the lockdown, I had a really useful and productive time in Turkey. I read a lot of books, learned some Turkish language basics, met a lot of people, gained a lot of knowledge about another culture and, most importantly, I stayed healthy. What would you say to people who might be interested in translating for Alison? I would say go ahead. It won’t take a lot of time for you to translate it but it’ll be of huge value to your fellow native speakers.

My name is Dldar Adil Muhammad. I’m 20 years old. I’m from Southern Kurdistan and I live in Erbil. I have a diploma in nursing. My native language is Kurdish. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? When I was searching for a coronavirus course, I came across the Alison coronavirus course. I enrolled and completed the course. When I had finished it, I saw that Alison was looking for volunteers to translate the course into many different languages. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? This was my first experience of studying with Alison and it’s been a very useful experience for me. It’s also been my first experience translating a course. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? First of all, not all Kurdish people know English, so translating this course into Kurdish is very useful for these people. It allows them to all be able to utilise Alison’s coronavirus course. Also, I see so much fake information about coronavirus on social media that I wanted to be able to present them with correct information through this course. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? Because this disease is a pandemic and can affect anyone, it’s important people learn how to protect themselves.

I am a 29 year old man from Myanmar. I graduated from university with a Bachelor of Law and also have an Engineering Vocational Diploma. I’m a civil engineer working in project management and am currently involved in a government project sponsored by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? Translation is my favourite hobby since my intermediate school days and I regularly get in touch with online learning websites. I was contacted by Alison to translate the coronavirus course from English to my native language, Myanmar. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I had studied with Alison before. Alison is great, with thousands of online courses for free. All the courses are really effective and they are easy to understand. If you have sufficient time to study with Alison, then I trust you will be very qualified in no time. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? I took part in this translation project in February, when the spread of coronavirus was increasing but had not yet infected our country, or most parts of Asia. I’m very interested in translation work and also the coronavirus seemed to become more and more of a threat to people’s lives. That’s why I joined the project. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? We have never experienced such a situation before and it is horrible. Due to the development of the internet and social media, misinformation has become a great threat to all of us. Therefore it is vitally important for everyone to have easy access to important information about coronavirus and related matters to avoid and defend against the impact of misinformation. Tell us a little about your method when translating. When translating, I use Google Translate for an approximate translation. But Google Translate has many limitations when it comes to my native language, Myanmar, because Myanmar is one of the most difficult languages in the world. But I get a raw translation from it and then I perfect it with my knowledge and by using dictionaries. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? In recent years, network development has massively increased in many countries but there are still many things that are yet to be accommodated, such as online billing systems. This means that we cannot pay for, and so cannot access, paid courses from where we are. But with free courses, it’s easy for everyone to take part and participate as long as there’s a network connection. Free learning is so important because it covers almost everyone. It’s also very important to translate courses into many languages. English is a global language but courses will be more effective, and more capable of reaching people around the globe, if they are translated into their native languages. Here in Myanmar, we are mostly poor in English and so to be more effective, translating courses into Myanmar is necessary, so that everyone globally can participate in learning. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? Yes, I’ve learned about coronavirus by participating in the translation project. During the lockdown, I was at work as our project is still running under the guidance of the government. So lockdown hasn’t meant anything to me, just regularity. What would you say to people who might be interested in translating for Alison? For those who are interested in translation, my opinion is that there are thousands of quality free learning courses out there and translating them into our native languages is very important, not only to allow others to be able to learn, but also for ourselves to promote our knowledge and abilities as translators.

For those who are interested in translation, my opinion is that there are thousands of quality free learning courses out there and translating them into our native languages is very important, not only to allow others to be able to learn, but also for ourselves to promote our knowledge and abilities as translators.

My name is Lerato Matsoso, a 34 year old woman from Rustenburg, North West Province in South Africa. I studied Climate Change Mitigation, Adaptation and Legal Regime under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its corona-virus course? I learned after I received an email from Alison in which we were invited to participate. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? Yes, I had studied courses with Alison before volunteering. I had an invaluable experience studying with Alison. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? It’s my UN Human Rights obligation to extend my help to people who can’t afford to learn the English language, especially people in deep rural parts of my native language geographical area. It was going to be easier for them to learn in their indigenous language. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? It’s an Obligation under the UN Human Rights Declaration, Articles 26, and the WHO International Health Protocol, Article 2005, that people have this information at their disposal. Tell us a little about your method when translating. This was my first time translating. Certain English words were easy to translate into my language but some other English words I found difficult. I used an extensive collaborative mechanism to resolve the translation of challenging English phrases to Southern Sotho. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? In terms of the UN Human Rights Declaration, Article 26, everyone has the right of access to free learning. Translating the course will also promote a language’s dignity. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? No, I haven’t been learning with Alison through the pandemic period. The lockdown measures resulted in not an easy situation. It’s the first time we have experienced national disaster measures like this.

I would encourage them to translate for Alison because they will get the chance to work with a cohort of educators and a supporting team.

I’m also working as a volunteer with the Kurdistan Medical Science Organisation and the Rema Group. I have also got certificates in several different scientific courses related to nursing, in order to improve my knowledge about my future job. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? My friend Bryar Ghafoor (another Alison translator) told me about this project. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? I decided to translate this course for two reasons. First of all, to help Kurdish people to gain some specific information about coronavirus. Secondly, Islam, my religion, teaches me to work as a volunteer at any time and in any situation. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? Everyone must know about coronavirus and its signs and symptoms so they will be able to recognise it if they are infected. Access to information also allows them to protect themselves and to promote healthy attitudes. Hopefully, this information will allow them to continue to live healthily. Tell us a little about your method when translating. I translated the course using my own English language skills and sometimes I used a dictionary. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Free learning is important to everyone because if learning is going to cost money then there will be some people who have a love of learning but won’t be able to attain it because they lack the money.

How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? After earning my Alison Diploma in Work Place Health & Safety, Alison was in contact with me and they have offered me a volunteer job translating the coronavirus course into Macedonian. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I was searching the web for a suitable online course, and I chose Alison. Alison’s online courses have an outstanding user-friendly platform, so I was happy to learn with them. I warmly recommend people who want to learn skills online to try Alison. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? Alison has got a professional and warm approach to their students, so I could not skip this offer. In the hard times of coronavirus, I had a lot of time and wanted to make a small contribution for people to learn more about coronavirus, so they could be aware and protect themselves and their communities. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? Coronavirus is highly virulent and mortal. Everyone should learn more and be aware of it. Educated people can easily protect themselves from coronavirus. Tell us a little about your method when translating. Working with internationals between 2002 and 2007, providing both written and oral translations, helped me to gain huge experience in this job. At the time, web translations were not available so I was mostly using my knowledge of English, and dictionaries for words in specific areas of expertise. Today, the internet offers a variety of translating apps but afterwards, the text must be cross-checked again. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Free learning is easy to find, there are a vast amount of topics and it’s free of charge.

My name is Andy Ho and I am from Singapore. I have been working in the Information Technology sector since 1998, and have had the privilege of working in various IT sectors both locally and overseas, including healthcare, media, higher education and most recently, the government sector. I am happily married to my beautiful wife Zoe Michele, and have been blessed with two wonderful kids, Michaela and Alexander. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? I have been an Alison user since 2017 and am subscribed to all newsletters. On 4 February 2020, the CEO & Founder, Mike Feerick, personally sent a newsletter to loyal Alison subscribers, with the subject title, “BREAKING – Coronavirus: Causes, Latest Known Symptoms, and Prevention”. This was in response to the international health threat of the coronavirus. Alison stepped up to the challenge of creating a short certificate course for users to study for free. The very next day, the Alison Team followed up with an email titled “Coronavirus: We need your help to make people aware, Andy!”. My parents, the late Mr Ho Sook Niou and Madam Helen, always taught me the values of being selfless and doing things for the greater good. I contacted the Alison team and offered my full assistance. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I have been a registered user of Alison since 2017. To date I have completed courses ranging from food safety to six sigma, from music theory to the current coronavirus course. When I joined the higher education sector, I was looking for opportunities to enrich myself in all areas. I realized the importance of lifelong learning, and with a rapidly changing world, it’s extremely important that we keep up to date with current trends. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? I saw the early struggles faced by Chinese-speaking countries where the citizens were struggling to access information, as much information was available in English only. Citizens were dying rapidly because of the lack of critical information in their own native language. The experience of working in multinational companies made me realise that even though the world’s countries have progressed significantly in terms of technology, critical life-saving information with regards to healthcare is still severely lacking, especially in many citizens’ native languages. I believed that I could make a significant difference by saving lives. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? The more information citizens have with regards to the coronavirus, the better equipped they will be to protect themselves and their love ones. In Singapore, it was evident: foreign workers were really experiencing the impact of COVID-19 as a huge number of them had no access to information in their native language. Tell us a little about your method when translating. I used the Excel master template provided by Alison, that split up the course into various sections. A Google Translation was also provided for our reference. Having a deep understanding of the Chinese language, I was well aware that not all Google translations would be accurate (including the characters being used). For each section that required translation, I copied the text onto Word, checked the Google translation and read it out loud to see how it sounded. I downloaded a Chinese software called NJStar, which allowed me to input Chinese characters via pinyin. After making my edits, I checked the full structure to ensure minimal loss in translation. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Free learning is important because there are millions of citizens in the world who are struggling to make ends meet, and can’t afford to pay to learn a skill or a life-saving course. Similarly there are millions of citizens who, because of a lack of education opportunities, continue to only speak their native language and hence are unable to obtain valuable life-saving information that is not available in their own language. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? I have benefited greatly from learning through Alison pre-pandemic, as well as during the pandemic. COVID-19 is the challenge of our generation, however, it provided accelerated opportunities for home-based learning and reskilling. What was previously unavailable, now became available through online learning. What would you say to people who might be interested in translating for Alison? You can make a difference! What may seem insignificant to some, becomes extremely beneficial (and in many ways a life saver) to others. Always be open to differences in opinions, and take that leap of faith!

So I decided to learn more about this new virus by searching online. I found that Alison was already providing education to people about this virus for free in one language, English, and that they wanted to translate this course into many languages around the globe. I offered my services for free translation and took part in translating this course into our language, Pashto. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I created an account on Alison 5 or 6 years ago as I saw that Alison provides an opportunity to learn any subject in any field. I have previously taken a course on the ebola virus. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? Everyone has the right to get information about the coronavirus in order to be able to understand it and to protect themselves from infection. I wanted to help educate local people.

I offered my services for free translation and took part in translating this course into our language, Pashto.","content_length":784,"content_tokens":176,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Meet Tariqur Rehman, our Pashto translator!","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alisons-coronavirus-course-translators-tariqur-rehman","essay_date":"Jul 1, 2020","essay_thanks":"","content":"What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate?

Everyone has the right to get information about the coronavirus in order to be able to understand it and to protect themselves from infection. I wanted to help educate local people. Tell us a little about your method when translating. I used Google Translate to translate the course but Google is not 100% correct so I used my own skills to correct the translation, as I have studied my language. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Nowadays almost everyone has access to the internet.

I’m Bryar Ghafoor. I’m 21 year old and I’m from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. I’m studying at the College of Nursing in the University of Sulaymaniyah. Alongside being a nurse, I spend my time developing my knowledge in different areas of IT like programming and website and application development. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? I was actually searching for free online courses and I found Alison through Google. I took the Physical Examination course because it related to my profession and then when the coronavirus course came up, I joined and completed the course. I realised it needed volunteers for translating so I volunteered for the coronavirus course translation into Kurdish with a group in college. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? One of the motivations behind my volunteering is my Islamic background. Allah motivates us to do good work in His cause and He will reward us. “But whatever thing you spend [in His cause] – He will compensate it; and He is the best of providers.” (Quran 34:39) What does good work look like? Must many people read what you have translated? The course may protect many people but “whoever saves one – it is as if he had saved mankind entirely.” (Quran 5:32) Another motivation is protecting my family, friends and all human beings – it’s a big achievement. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? This information is very important as it’s related to human lives. We always need new developments to make human life better. We are sharing information with the public to give them an idea about protection methods and how the virus is transferred from one person to another. This will decrease the virus infection rate and mortality rate. Basically it’s saving a lot of lives. Tell us a little about your method when translating. Our team of nine students from college decided to translate this course and we worked as a team to translate it into Kurdish. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Not everyone can access paid courses. Especially for something like coronavirus, which is related to human lives, information should be public and free. Translating into many languages gives access to the many people who don’t speak English. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? I spent my time learning new skills and Alison has been a good source to start. The coronavirus course itself gave me more knowledge about this virus and also increased my translating skills. What would you say to people who might be interested in translating for Alison? If you think your translation will be useful then why not start now? Go ahead.

I am now doing my studies in university. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? This is a time of crisis here in Borno State, Nigeria and as a result I have nothing to do. I searched online and found Alison. I took a diploma course online and graduated. So I started following Alison online. When I saw the call for translators, I wanted to engage because I’m interested in it and I have nothing to do for now. Tell us a little about your method when translating. For me it wasn’t difficult because, in primary school, I studied the Hausa language. I’ve also succeeded in many exams and competitions on the language so I didn’t face any difficulties when translating it. I also did English in school. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Free learning is very important for times like now. There is no school for now because of this coronavirus and so we have nothing to do. We are sitting at home, no job, doing nothing. And so having our studies helps us. People here often don’t learn English in school and so they can’t read it. Hausa is the main language here in our country.

I have learned many things on coronavirus and also other courses. What would you say to people who might be interested in translating for Alison? I have many people asking me about Alison. For example, last time, when you sent me my certificate, many people asked me how did I get the certificate? I told them about how I got it – how I found the website and engaged myself on it. I also told them that I even participated as a volunteer, and now many people have joined. This morning, I’ve told so many people that I have an interview with Alison and they have all asked me for the website. Many people have now engaged themselves online with diploma courses with Alison. How has the lockdown been for you?

My name is Fiza. I am from Pakistan. I hold an MPhil degree in Biochemistry. In my free time, I am a digital learner and a translator. I usually translate from English to my native language, Urdu. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? I had completed the free course, Coronavirus- What you need to know, and I noticed it was open for translation in multiple languages. I volunteered right away. A few days later, I received an invitation email from Alison to translate. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I have been an Alison learner since 2016. I have completed four courses: How to plan your career path, Zika Virus – What You Need To Know, Global Health Initiative: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Awareness and Coronavirus – What you need to know. The coronavirus course content was well-designed for the general public. Alison courses are short, well-structured and informative. All courses are self-paced which means the learner completes them in their own time. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? Online translations into my language are mostly not reliable. I saw an opportunity to put my educational background and language skills to good use. So I volunteered to translate. I just enjoy translating, it helps me to express myself. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? Access to free and reliable information is every human’s right. Everyone should have access to coronavirus information. This way they can keep themselves safe and take care of people around them. In this digital era, free learning has become a necessity. Tell us a little about your method when translating. Being a native Urdu speaker and having a degree in science played a big role in my translation work. I mostly do my own translations. I don’t rely on machine translations. Urdu is a complex language and has a diverse vocabulary. Machine translations fail to do justice to it. I used different dictionaries for choosing the right vocabulary. I avoided complex words to make my translation easy to understand for learners of all age groups. I took utmost care in translating so that anyone with basic Urdu reading skills can take the course. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Free learning is every human’s right and digital resources have made free learning possible. Translating expands free learning, making important information accessible to a wider audience. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? Yes. In the initial months of the pandemic, my home country wasn’t severely affected. I took Alison’s special coronavirus course. The course kept me informed and well-prepared. Then during the lockdown, I translated the coronavirus course. I have also been involved in various volunteer works. It’s still lockdown here in my country and I have taken up a few more Alison courses. What would you say to people who might be interested in translating for Alison? If giving back to society excites you, come aboard to translate with Alison. Lend a hand to make free learning available to a large audience. Every little effort counts.

Because I am a student of Alison I received an email saying that, due to the current difficult situation, Alison is going to spread their coronavirus course all around the world.

Free learning provides an OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL, especially for those who are not allowed to access alternative education.

My name is Charles Abrahams. I am 58 years old. I am currently working as an assistant teacher and an administrative officer at Grassdale High School in Cape Town. I teach Business Studies to Grades 8 to 12. I worked at this school from 1983 to 1990, left to work in retail until 2007, and then returned. I’m a very dedicated educator and have a passion to educate young people. I am also a tutor in Business Studies. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? I saw in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic that translations were sought to make information of the virus known to all nations in their mother language. I love translating and I have done several translations from English to Afrikaans. I completed the coronavirus course and I felt I wanted to be part of Alison’s translator team. So I volunteered my services to Alison. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I was introduced to Alison in 2014 or 2015. I did the Diploma in Educational Psychology. I also did several courses to further my skills in education. I will never stop studying with Alison. It just feels good to pass your certificate or diploma. I have even gone back and done revised courses. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? The reason for offering to translate is to help people in South African communities to be able to understand know how serious and dangerous this virus is. They need to have the necessary information about COVID19 in their own mother language. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? It is of the utmost importance that everyone has a clear understanding of the severity of this disease. Prevention, keeping safe from contracting the virus, how to stay healthy, how not to infect others, all of this needs to be made clear in every language. We need to flatten the curve by making everyone aware. Tell us a little about your method when translating. I love translating to Afrikaans, which is like Dutch. I take every piece that needs to be translated and read it though thoroughly. I identify tenses and sentences structure and find the most appropriate words in Afrikaans. Then I structure the sentences to make sense to the reader. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? I am part of the educational community and so free learning is important to me. It’s important for everyone to have access to studies. Alison is the only institution that helps the world to get educated. This medium seeks to empower everyone will help people to overcome poverty. The courses and diplomas Alison offers are current. Alison keeps up with the latest developments. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? I have begun new diploma courses during lockdown and I am so excited about the the fact that I have two diploma courses to keep me busy. We are still in lockdown but my grade 12 learners are back and the other grades will follow, so I need to work hard to complete these courses. What would you say to people who might be interested in translating for Alison? I would encourage everyone who is able to translate to join this team. People who translate help people to gain knowledge in their own language. It will enable more people across the globe to study and it will empower them. Knowledge enlightens and knowledge is power. It enables communities and nations to empower themselves.

I currently work at an urgent healthcare clinic in Jerusalem, as well as working at a college as a coordinator for the center of learning disabilities. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? I googled courses regarding COVID-19 and I was redirected to the Alison homepage. I saw that there were courses in other languages, including Hebrew, which needed translation. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I had not studied with Alison before but I have heard the name multiple times through American friends, and also on some online platforms for MOOC recommendations. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? Honestly, because it’s important and no one else had taken the initiative to do so. I think that a proper education regarding COVID-19 is a basic necessity and all people should educate themselves from a reputable platform before listening to people who may not know what they’re talking about. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? In the end, you are your own judge. I always tell people to understand a topic before making decisions. Learn about COVID-19 before having anxiety or completely disregarding its existence. Tell us a little about your method when translating. I like to fully read and understand a section before roughly translating it. Then, after all of it is translated, I go over it again and fix some mistakes or choose better words or synonyms for words that repeat themselves a lot. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Because not everyone has access to education. Yes, platforms like YouTube offer many educational programs, but it’s mostly subjective and only available in one language. An education platform that is free and available in many languages makes it so much easier for a person who doesn’t speak English (or any other mainstream language) to get a proper education which will help self-growth. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? I actually took the COVID-19 course through Alison. Lockdown has been very interesting here in Israel.

GDPR brings all EU countries in line in how they protect the data and privacy of their citizens and is one of the most important laws to come out of Europe in recent years. Any business that is either established in the EU, or sells goods or services to EU citizens (or processes their data), must comply with the rules set out under GDPR. GDPR doesn’t just cover how companies process data, but how that data is stored and exchanged. Organisations that are subject to GDPR must be able to demonstrate that they are following the regulations and that the data in their possession is secure. For many companies, this means either updating or completely overhauling how they do business, both on paper and online. As GDPR is such a huge piece of regulation, keeping up to date on all of the rules can be difficult. However, if an organisation fails to comply, they can face a fine of up to €20 million or 4% of their global annual turnover. In order to help businesses correctly interpret GDPR and to implement the necessary measures to protect their customers’ data, Alison has published a highly popular course on understanding GDPR.

My name is Thomas Lamarre Dugue. I am Haitian and I live in Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haïti. I am married and I have three children. I’m a computer specialist and a network security expert. From 2002 to 2010, I worked for a medical research organisation in my country as a Data Manager and a Quality Assurance and Quality Control officer on research studies on HIV/AIDS. Currently, I am the Technology Director at a Christian school in Haïti. Beside this, I also provide technology support both on site and remotely to various clients. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? In February 2020, a few weeks after I successfully passed the free coronavirus course, I received an email from Alison looking for volunteers to translate the course into different languages, so I decided to volunteer. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I’ve studied courses with Alison since 2010, among them, the coronavirus course. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? I am a Christian and I know that the Bible says in Philippians 2:4 “Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.” This is what Alison has done. If I could learn a lot about COVID-19 from Alison for free, it is because someone else made it available in English. This has inspired me to help to make this course available in Haitian Creole for my fellow citizens since few speak English. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? This is a new pandemic virus and, as time has showed us, no one has a clear and exact answer to it. So the more we know about the evolution of the virus, the more we can protect others and ourselves. Tell us a little about your method when translating. My primary languages are both Haitian Creole and French. Because I learned English and practice it almost every day due to my work environment, it was quite easy for me to just translate from English to Creole, Google Translate the English version to French and then practice a sort of back translation by comparing the French version with my translated Creole version. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? I would say that, whether it is free or paid, learning is important since what you know today may change tomorrow. One needs to be in the loop. In my country in particular, a lot of people would learn a lot of things but nearly 99% of the time, money is a barrier. It happened to me, so I know how valuable it is to acquire knowledge when you are broke but willing to change your situation. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? Yes, since the beginning in February 2020. The lockdown was, and is still, challenging. In Haïti, as of mid June, we are still in lockdown mode. But with the help of technology, I still can do a lot while remaining at home. What would you say to people who might be interested in translating for Alison? We need a better world. Everyone can positively contribute to help make things easier for needy people and for anyone else too. While we cannot share all our tangible belongings with everyone, we can share our knowledge with all. If you’d like to play your part in overcoming the coronavirus pandemic by helping Alison give people access to the information necessary to keep themselves and their loved ones safe, please get in touch.","length":3606,"tokens":761,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Meet Thomas L Dugue, our Haitian Creole translator!","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alisons-coronavirus-course-translators-thomas-l-dugue","essay_date":"Jun 19, 2020","essay_thanks":"","content":"Thomas, tell us a bit about yourself and your background.

I did the GDPR course, which was very important for my job. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? I thought it would be very useful and that it could help other people. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? In my opinion, if everyone has access to the correct information then it should help little bit with calming down the panic about coronavirus, and also with slowing down the transmission of the virus. Tell us a little about your method when translating. Alison sent me the course text in some very well organised spreadsheets, which was easy to translate. But sometimes a direct translation was inadequate because our language is very difficult.

I’m a Sudanese doctor working in Saudi Arabia for the last five years as a GP. When the pandemic started, I had just received my Occupational English Test result that will allow me to register for work in western countries. Currently, I am working on moving to the UK or Ireland. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? Because of my work, I have to keep updated on any dangerous diseases and I have been keeping up with this pandemic’s progress since it started. I have been providing orientations and presentations, which led me to check on Alison to see if there were any related courses. I found Coronavirus – What you need to know and, after finishing it, I thought it was an impressive course and that more Arabic-speaking people needed to learn about it. I volunteered and started to translate immediately. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? Yes, indeed. I studied English Grammar and two diplomas, in English and in Human Resources. I also invited my brother to start to learn from your website. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? In a situation like that of COVID19, having access to clear and accurate information can be the difference between life and death for some people. Having translated versions of the course is essential to allow people to learn about the coronavirus origin, spread and all related information. Also, I feel that by helping translate this course, I am contributing much better information to people than what is being presented to them through regular or governmental media. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? Ignorance about how to prevent the transmission of this virus can lead to a faster spread that will lead to higher casualties. In the end, those who will be infected most of the time are one’s family members. Tell us a little about your method when translating. I used Google Translate on each paragraph and then I would read through it in Arabic and make the necessary corrections as I read it. I found if I put in more text than that, the translation would be wrong. Sometimes the changes were few, and other times it really required me to go through it all to make sure it was accurate. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Knowledge is power. Not everyone has access to medical information and, without a doubt, everyone needs to be aware of the disease during a pandemic. Everyone needs to know how to survive, and with these provided translations, they may have a better chance to learn how to fight it in their homes and survive. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? For me, as far as I remember, my work has never been busier. I have to work more hours and the workload has increased tremendously. As it became clear that the pandemic was spreading faster than anyone had anticipated, my Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board 1 Exam was cancelled due to the lockdown, as a result of the fear of the virus spreading.

How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? Since I am an Alison user, I receive updates and newsletters by email and so I came across the opportunity to collaborate in a translation of the course into Catalan. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I have been an Alison user since 2017 and I receive regular updates. I’m familiar with the variety of areas in which Alison provides online courses. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? When I learned about the opportunity to translate this course to Catalan, I wanted to get involved, although I am not a professional translator.

Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? Coronavirus has spread worldwide faster than other diseases.

Today, these free resources can quickly circulate through the internet and reach anyone with a connection. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic?

I was born and raised in Aba, Abia State in Nigeria. I have a Diploma in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the Institute of Management and Technology in Nigeria as well as a Certificate in Electrical Construction from the Master Artisan Academy, South Africa. I’m currently residing and running my own business in Johannesburg, South Africa, and studying for an MBA at The University of The People. In 2014, I started Achinnor Investments Pty Ltd in South Africa. Achinnor imports and sells various types of hair products and cosmetics. In 2016, I started Rek Beauty Collections Pty Ltd. We make and sell traditional African outfits. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? I was approached by Alison to volunteer for translating through an email. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I have studied and completed several courses with Alison, including Diploma In Business Communication Skills, Diploma In Project Management, Introduction To Communication Skills, Introduction To E-Learning Theory And Practice and Skills For Speaking Effectively: The Art Of Speaking. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? I have always been on the lookout for opportunities to give back to my community and I saw the translation as one. I believed that if I helped to translate the course into my language, it would increase understanding of the virus, the risks, and ways to reduce the spread of the virus. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? I believe it is important for everyone to have access to information on coronavirus because it will help them to protect themselves and others from the risk of getting infected. Tell us a little about your method when translating? As opposed to direct, word-for-word translation, I focused on conveying the information in an easy to understand manner. I used spoken language translation, translating into the way the language is spoken in everyday life. For instance, I translated “COURSE” to “KỌỌS” as this is understood to mean ‘learning of a particular subject’, instead of the literal meaning, which could have been difficult to understand. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Learning is vital to attaining one’s full potential. It helps in becoming successful in family, at work and within the local community. However, the cost of learning has continued to deprive many people of these opportunities. Free learning is therefore essential for the less privileged to attain success. I know of people who are intelligent, willing and able to learn but cannot afford it. Free learning means a lot to them. It is important to translate learning into many languages because learning in your first language makes the learning process exciting and more appealing to the learner. It also helps to get a quick and better understanding of the subject matter. How has the lockdown been for you? The lockdown is not good news to many, myself included. The lockdown has affected me in different ways. First the good side: I have been upskilling myself, thanks to Alison’s free online learning. I have also been spending quality time with my family. The bad side: Just like many others, my businesses are closed and the cost of maintaining a business under lockdown is high. Banks calls for loan repayments, there is difficulty in accessing financial aid and much more. Nevertheless, I hope the lockdown will end soon so we can pick up our pieces and move on.

Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? I have always been on the lookout for opportunities to give back to my community and I saw the translation as one. I believed that if I helped to translate the course into my language, it would increase understanding of the virus, the risks, and ways to reduce the spread of the virus.

I believe it is important for everyone to have access to information on coronavirus because it will help them to protect themselves and others from the risk of getting infected.","content_length":993,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Meet Reward Emeka, our Igbo language translator!","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alisons-coronavirus-course-translators-reward-emeka","essay_date":"Jun 18, 2020","essay_thanks":"","content":"Tell us a little about your method when translating? As opposed to direct, word-for-word translation, I focused on conveying the information in an easy to understand manner. I used spoken language translation, translating into the way the language is spoken in everyday life. For instance, I translated “COURSE” to “KỌỌS” as this is understood to mean ‘learning of a particular subject’, instead of the literal meaning, which could have been difficult to understand. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? Learning is vital to attaining one’s full potential. It helps in becoming successful in family, at work and within the local community. However, the cost of learning has continued to deprive many people of these opportunities. Free learning is therefore essential for the less privileged to attain success.","content_length":868,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Meet Reward Emeka, our Igbo language translator!","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alisons-coronavirus-course-translators-reward-emeka","essay_date":"Jun 18, 2020","essay_thanks":"","content":"I know of people who are intelligent, willing and able to learn but cannot afford it.

The lockdown has affected me in different ways. First the good side: I have been upskilling myself, thanks to Alison’s free online learning. I have also been spending quality time with my family. The bad side: Just like many others, my businesses are closed and the cost of maintaining a business under lockdown is high. Banks calls for loan repayments, there is difficulty in accessing financial aid and much more. Nevertheless, I hope the lockdown will end soon so we can pick up our pieces and move on.","content_length":963,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"Meet Reward Emeka, our Igbo language translator!","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alisons-coronavirus-course-translators-reward-emeka","essay_date":"Jun 18, 2020","essay_thanks":"","content":"What would you say to people who might be interested in translating for Alison?

I’m an author, an academician, a legal researcher and also a criminologist in English and international law. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? I received an email from Alison that they were looking for translation volunteers, so I volunteered for my languages. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? Yes, I often study with Alison. It provides a very nice working environment, without any conflict with others. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? I offered because I love helping people. If I can translate this course, then thousands of Bengali people can learn about coronavirus and the protective measures which will help Indian and Bengali communities to protect themselves from coronavirus. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on coronavirus? After SARS and MERS, this virus is a second generation virus and can bind to human cells quicker than previous generations. We don’t yet have a vaccine approved by the WHO so knowledge is the only power to fight against this virus. People must know the reasons behind protective measures in order to best apply them. Tell us a little about your method when translating. I don’t believe in Google Translate. I translated the document using Bengali Online Keyboard. Why is free learning so important and why is it important to translate it into many languages? The right to education is granted to everyone by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Charter. If a country’s constitution skips that right, or fails to implement it, then people have their right to education enforceable under international law. Free education is required because it’s a right.

I was explaining the actions of the British Government to people about why it’s necessary to stay at home at this time. I’m also advocating on coronavirus for UN2020, which includes all UN organisations, as well as participating in Hackathon & Matchathon, events arranged by the UN, the EU, Switzerland, Greece and Latvia.

My name is Zoe and I participated in Alison’s English to Korean translation. I live in Korea and I am a Korean medical doctor, with a license for traditional Korean medicine. I’m also a freelance translator who specialises in the field of English to Korean medical translation. How did you learn that Alison was looking for translators for its coronavirus course? As a freelance English to Korean translator, I often check the information of different translation companies on LinkedIn. As the pandemic got worse, I saw Alison’s recruitment notice for coronavirus course translators on LinkedIn. What was your experience of Alison before volunteering to translate? Had you studied with Alison before? I had read some articles introducing Alison as a free online education site. I was interested in online education sites because I’ve participated in translating these kinds of online courses as a freelance translator. I haven’t received any actual education there yet, but I want to study with Alison in the future. Why did you offer to translate our coronavirus course? As everyone knows, South Korea has been dealing with COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic but, gradually, the virus spread all over the world. I saw an article that a lack of information and misinformation about the virus promoted infection. I thought that the right information was essential in the response to the pandemic. I happened to see Alison’s notice and thought participating in this would help others. Why is it important that everyone has access to important information on Coronavirus? Although many epidemics have swept the world, COVID-19 is highly contagious and is having a significant impact worldwide. Especially in the early stages of the response, there were many problems, such as discrimination against Asians or the prevalence of incorrect treatment or prevention methods. Everyone should use the right information to respond to the virus and reduce these side effects properly. Tell us a little about your method when translating. I use computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools for accuracy and consistency. Also, when translating documents related to significant issues, such as COVID-19, I refer to reliable announcements such as those from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. My medical knowledge as a Korean medical doctor has also been useful. Why is free learning so important, and why is it important to translate it into many languages? During the pandemic, it was reported that the infection and mortality rates were significantly higher in low-income and underdeveloped areas. Also, false information about the virus often led to incidents. Even in an information society, in which the world is connected to the internet, the “digital divide” is still a social problem. We need to solve this problem, not just in times of pandemics, but for all future generations. Free education will narrow this gap and is essential in eliminating language barriers to spreading information. Have you been learning through Alison during the pandemic? How has the lockdown been for you? While translating for Alison, I also got a lot of information about the coronavirus myself. Fortunately, there was no “lockdown” in Korea. Korea was able to control the spread of the virus stably without a lockdown due to transparent information disclosure and quick examination. Of course, there were inconveniences, such as wearing face masks and avoiding crowded places, but I have been doing well. What would you say to people who might be interested in translating for Alison? As a Korean medical doctor and a freelance English translator, the translation of the coronavirus course with Alison meant a lot to me. It was a great pleasure to break down the barrier of language so that people could use the information they needed more easily. I would like to ask people to participate in finding opportunities to help others with their abilities. Everyone can make this world healthier.

The story goes as follows: When I first came up with the vision of a website that could teach for free anyone, anywhere, on any subject, at any time, I knew that coming up with the right name was very important. As the old Chinese sage Confucius was reported to have said (and I paraphrase!) “Calling something by its right name is the beginning of all wisdom”. The name of the project/website had to have certain basic qualities: (i) It had to be a simple name easily said. The name phonetically had to roll off any tongue in any language, as our goal from day one was to have a large global website with learners studying in every country. (ii) It had to be a generic, benign word to begin with – something like “Google” that could morph into many things. What I did not want to call the website was “Free Online Learning. org” as what we were planning to build was so much more than providing free learning alone. (iii) It should begin with the letter “A”. It’s one of the most basic marketing strategies, as starting with “A” gets you placed naturally at the top of many listings. I remember some years later listening to an interview with Jack Ma at the World Economic Forum in Davos, in which he said he came up with the name Alibaba partly also because of the letter “A”! There was another reason for the “A” letter: the original company (which sold IT Desktop Training courses online) was called “Advance Learning”, so from there, I got the “A” and the “L”. When I thought of the “Alison” name, I had to look to see if the domain was taken, and indeed it was, by a very nice American lady by the name of: you guessed it, “Alison”. Not only is the right name important, but having the matching domain/URL equally so. I found out that “Alison” was living in New Jersey, USA. I reached out and got a speedy reply. No, she wasn’t interested. “I like having this domain name” she said, and who would not like to have their own matching namesake domain for themselves? Unsurprised, I persisted. Alison told me she had over 100 inquiries from China alone trying to buy the name. Then she asked me the golden question after some friendly exchanges: “What do you want it for?” I knew I had a chance when she asked that question. As carefully as I could, I wrote out my vision for educating the world for free. I shared with her some of my background; that I had already started a number of web-based businesses, and how the social mission and impact of what we could do was what excited me most. She asked for some time to think about it. She really did like having that domain name! Sometime early in 2007, I received the email I was hoping for. Yes, we could have the domain name. A month later, for a once-off payment of $10,000, and a dinner and show on Broadway (Yes, how theatrical!), the domain was ours. While we notched up our 13 millionth registered learner a few days ago, we are still at the beginning of our free global learning journey. I have not been in contact with Alison for many years, but I hope she is happy with how we have used her precious domain name around the world. It reminds me how many acts of goodwill around the world have helped us to get this far. What’s in a name? Well, everything. You make it become something that in time stands alone. We hope the Alison name will become even more synonymous with free learning and empowerment in the years ahead.

I have not been in contact with Alison for many years, but I hope she is happy with how we have used her precious domain name around the world. It reminds me how many acts of goodwill around the world have helped us to get this far. What’s in a name? Well, everything. You make it become something that in time stands alone. We hope the Alison name will become even more synonymous with free learning and empowerment in the years ahead. For my part, I invite you too to help build the brand of Alison by telling someone new about Alison when you can! Hope you enjoyed the story! You can follow me on Twitter and Linkedin.

It was from a professor at Tsinghua University, one of China’s most prestigious universities (Xi Jinping, the current Chinese leader, went there). The professor was excited by the launch of Alison and was an early user. He made an exciting proposal: If Alison would fund the purchase of a trophy cup, he would assign his students the task of developing a “Market Entry Strategy for China” for which the best business plan would win a competition. It was an exciting proposal and it took no time to accept his kind offer. Three weeks later, ten 20-page Business Plans for Alison arrived into our offices in Galway, Ireland. It was overwhelming. Although hugely grateful for the efforts of these young business students (some of the plans were really excellent), I was left with one feeling: China was different. If Alison was going to engage with the Chinese market, it was going to have to do it right. If and when we were going to develop our learner and graduate database in China, we were going to need a focused team working on it, and most likely, a team based in China itself. An amazing 12 years onwards, we have finally established that Chinese presence. Our Chinese HQ is based in Xian, the ancient capital of China. This is exciting for me as a history buff, and for those of you who know of my passion for tracing Diaspora around the world, it adds fun to the experiment. Our early efforts are bearing fruit. Last week, China was our 4th highest volume country in the world, after the United States, the United Kingdom, and India. Our early focus in China is in Learning English. While a complete translation of the Alison website into Chinese is a while away, key pages such as Learn English and a general introduction to Alison are already busy with Chinese traffic. We are creating presences in Chinese on each of the Western equivalent platforms such as Weibo (Twitter), and Toutiao. We have literally millions of people studying with Alison worldwide, and over 2 million have studied English for free with us. Our free offering of over 60 free English courses matches very accurately with what is taught in the longer established English language standards from Cambridge and IELTS. In 2015, I travelled to Dalian, China to speak at an online learning conference. This was my first visit to China in over 20 years. It was exciting to visit modern China – so full of optimism and ambition, and so clearly well progressed since my last visit. As I do wherever I go, I sought out Alison graduates to meet with and learn from. I came away with pages of notes of advice on how we should develop our presence in China. Hopefully, we will do some justice to all the effort that went into teaching me about the potential of free online learning in China! That invitation remains open. If you would like to suggest how best we extend our free learning revolution into China, please do make contact with me through [email protected] or post your thoughts or ideas on our website or social media. We have a busy presence on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. As the Tsinghua students warned many years ago, we don’t want to treat China as ‘just another country’ that will accept a generic global offering. From the ancient days of Xian in its prime, to its growing strengths in the world today, we want to treat China differently, and help bring more people from the ancient kingdom the gift and empowerment of knowledge and workplace skills.","length":3583,"tokens":738,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"Alison in China: Taking on the Chinese Learning Dragon Differently","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/alison-in-china-taking-on-the-chinese-learning-dragon-differently","essay_date":"Feb 5, 2019","essay_thanks":"","content":"By Mike Feerick, Alison CEO & Founder Just a few short months after launching Alison in April 2007, I received a curious email from China.

Travel: there really is nothing like it. Just around the corner, a few hours in a car or a plane, something new and exciting is waiting to be discovered. Everyone has their own reason for travelling, whether it’s experiencing a new culture, taking in some beautiful views, or just getting away from all the things you have to do in your everyday life. The question is never “should I travel?” It’s “where should I go next?” So, to help you choose your next travel destination, I’ve put together a list of some incredible locations that are perfect for different types of holidays. I’ve tried to include something for everyone, so hopefully one or two of these locations will stand out for you. Check out the list, and start getting ready for your next holiday! For Photos: Italy From gorgeous landscapes of lakes and mountains, to sandy beaches and breathtaking ancient architecture, Italy is bursting with beauty. With a few basic photography skills, the perfect snap is waiting for you somewhere in the streets of Rome or out in the Tuscan countryside. For Fitness: The French Alps Some people don’t want to get away from it all. If you’re one of those people who see travel as a chance to conquer a new challenge, you can’t go wrong with the French Alps. Spend a few months working on your fitness, then hop on a bike and do a mini-Tour de France of your own in this spectacular landscape. For Food: Spain Spanish food is hard to beat. A delicious blend of European, Caribbean, and Arabic influences, there is just something unique about what you’ll find hidden away in quiet restaurants in the Spanish countryside. Just make sure you learn how to order food in Spanish before you go! For Great Fun: Ireland With some of the friendliest people on the planet and a truly beautiful landscape, Ireland is an excellent holiday location. Whether it’s having a few drinks in Dublin, taking in the wild Atlantic coastline, or practicing your English in good company, this is a travel destination you will never forget. For Getting Away From Everything: Norway If you just want to escape, to get away from all the work and little annoying things in your life, then head to Norway. On top of unbeatable mountains, beneath the Northern Lights or under the Midnight Sun, you can let your problems just fade away for a short while. There really is nothing better for stress management than a little getaway.","length":2411,"tokens":516,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"The Best Travel Destinations for Your 2019","essay_url":"https://alison.com/blog/the-best-travel-destinations-for-your-2019","essay_date":"Jan 20, 2019","essay_thanks":"","content":"By Philip S.

Many people dream of working for themselves, but worry that they might not have the ability to be a successful entrepreneur. After all, becoming self-employed can be a big leap into the unknown; most people spend a lot of their young lives working for someone else. When trying to decide if becoming an entrepreneur is the right move, you may find yourself asking, “Can I really do this?” Don’t worry. It turns out, many of your preconceptions about the habits and personalities of self-employed people might be completely false. Patrick Adcock of QuickBooks Self-Employed recently surveyed around 1000 self-employed people in order to gain a better understanding of what makes them unique. He shared his data with Alison, and the findings are fascinating. Apparently, the self-employed aren’t the extroverted rule-breakers many people think they are! Here’s a summary of some of the key findings from QuickBooks’ research. Have a read, and see if a career as an entrepreneur might be the path for you. 1. Self-Employed People Are Not Experts One of the most common things uniting self-employed workers is that they are jacks-of-all-trades rather than masters of one. When asked about their strengths, the most emphasised answers were passion, problem-solving, and adaptability. Entrepreneurs don’t start their businesses because they are experts in a certain field, but because they are passionate about their field and want to get involved in every area of it. 2. They Care A Lot About Learning A huge 94 percent of those surveyed consider themselves lifelong learners. More than a quarter say that they can learn enough to achieve their goals because they simply want it enough. Another 22 percent say it comes down to having enough passion. Nearly 20 percent say the only thing separating “wantrepreneurs” from entrepreneurs is one hasn’t started yet. 3. The Self-Employed Learn Outside of School According to self-employed workers, you don’t learn how to start a business from school, books, or a business coach. The top five ways they learned how to start their businesses were using online resources, learning as they went along, learning from mistakes, learning from friends and family, and having a natural instinct or talent for it. 4. They Value Time, People, and Hard Work About 84 percent of self-employed people see their success as a result of their hard work rather than luck. 3 out of 4 value time more than money, 73 percent value people over profits, and 77 percent say they push to do the impossible instead of giving up when they hit obstacles. It’s these values that give them the passion to continue when others would give up. Ultimately, what all of this boils down to is: find a passion, learn all you can about it, keep learning, keep going, and don’t be put off by obstacles. These are the traits that make entrepreneurs successful and can get you started on a wonderful career path. So whether its hospitality or agriculture, manufacturing or IT, start learning today and become the captain of your own ship.

Happy New Year! Well done, you got through 2018. Was it fun? Was it tough? Were there good times and bad times? I’m sure there were, every year is different and every year can bring lots of good and lots of bad. Some of this is beyond our control, and we just have to accept that life isn’t always easy. But one thing is in our control: what we decide we want to achieve. Even if the world gets in the way and we don’t achieve it in the end, we can decide what we want to happen in our lives. This doesn’t have to be completely ridiculous (I’m not hoping to grow a tail this year) but it doesn’t have to be too serious either (I’m also not dreaming about getting to work on time every day). It’s just really nice to have some fun and possibly achievable dreams on the horison. So, to help you choose your New Year’s Resolutions this year, here’s a list of some ideas. They are probably not all for you, but maybe there’s something just right for you in there. Have a look, and Happy New Year!
